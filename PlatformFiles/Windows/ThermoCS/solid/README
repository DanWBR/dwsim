Specifications for solid-gas equilibrium data

- number of different solid phases 

- max. temperature up to which solid phases can exist

- for each solid phase:
  - solid phase indicator (e.g., s1, s2, ...)
  - number of experimental data sets
  - as many data sets consisting of
    T/K (temperature), p/MPa (sublimation or melting pressure),
    v/cm3mol-1 (solid molar volume), kappaT/MPa-1 (solid isothermal
    compressibility).
    NOTE: The data sets must be arranged in DESCENDING ORDER with respect
    to temperature.
