<hr>
<p>The Triangular Phase Envelope utility allows the visualisation of liquid-liquid equilibria phase maps
between three different components.</p>

<p>The blue area depicts the compositions where the mixture is unstable and splits into two liquids. 
The konode lines inside that area connect two points (yellow) which represent the two liquid compositions in equilibrium with each other. 
Edges of that diagram represent a pure component whereas the border lines opposite to these edges represent 
compositions containing zero concentration of that component. The scale of the axis is displayed as molar fraction.
