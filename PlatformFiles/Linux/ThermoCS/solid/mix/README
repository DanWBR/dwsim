Specifications for solid states with limited miscibility:

To provide parameters for the solubility of compound A in crystalline B
create a file named "<B>+<A>" with the following contents:

- for each solid phase specified in $THHOME/solid/<B>
  give the maximum n_A/n_B ratio,
  the insertion energy for an A molecule into the B crystal (in K),
  its pressure dependence (in K/MPa),
  and its temperature dependence (in K/K).

NOTE: Begin with the high-temperature phase!
