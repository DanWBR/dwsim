thermochemical data:

content:

Tref:		reference temperature (298.15 K)
H:		molar standard enthalpy (at T_ref, 0.1 MPa) [J/mol]
S:		absolute molar standard entropy [J/(mol K)]
n:		number of (T, Cpm) pairs
T, Cpm:		temperature, isobaric heat capacity

note: Give Cpm for non-volatile substances only! For volatile
substances it is better to specify Cpm of the ideal gas and
to apply the equation of state.
