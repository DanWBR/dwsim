STRUCTURE OF PARAMETER FILES

The parameters are stored in directories named after the equations of
state and the mixing theories. The arrangement of the directories
is the same as in the "models" tree.

In these directories, each substance and each mixture is represented
by a single file.


PURE SUBSTANCES

file name: COMPOUND;ID

content:   lines of the form "KEYWORD: VALUE" as follows:
    name:	name of the compound, same as in file name
		Names must not contain white space!
    id:		identifier, same as in file name
		There may be more than one parameter set for a compound; the
		ID number helps to distinguish between them.
    pc:		critical pressure in MPa
    Tc:		critical temperature in K
    vc:		critical molar volume in cm3/mol
    par[0]:	molar mass in g/mol
    par[1]:	attraction parameter, characteristic temperature in K
    par[2]:	covolume, molecular core size in cm3/mol
     ...
    par[i]:	other parameters required by the equation of state
			

BINARY MIXTURES

file name: COMPOUND1+COMPOUND2;ID

content:   lines of the form "KEYWORD: VALUE" as follows:
    name1:	name of the 1st compound, same as in file name
		- preferably the compound with the lower critical temperature
    id1:	ID number of its parameter set
    name2:	name of the 2nd compound, same as in file name
		- preferably the compound with the higher critical temperature
    id2:	ID number of its parameter set
    id:		identifier, same as in file name
		There may be more than one parameter set for a mixture; the
		ID number helps to distinguish between them.
     ...
    par[i]:	parameters required by the mixing theory


MULTI-COMPONENT MIXTURES

For an n-component mixture it is necessary to know k = (n-1)n/2 pair
interaction parameter sets. Such sets are registered in link files
named "multiNN".

file name: multiNN	with NN = n, number of components, e.g., "multi03"
			for 3-component mixtures

content:   blocks of k+1 lines, each block consisting of a mixture name
	   (n substance names separated by "+", followed by ";ID")
	   and k names of binary parameter files, e.g.:

-------------------------------
hydrogen+argon+carbon_dioxide;1
  hydrogen+argon;1
  hydrogen+carbon_dioxide;1
  argon+carbon_dioxide;1
-------------------------------
