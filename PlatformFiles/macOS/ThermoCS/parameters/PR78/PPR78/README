For this mixing rule, the parameter files are dummies, as the PPR78/1FGC
parameters are obtained from a group contribution model.

File "groups" contains the defined groups and their interaction parameters
A_ij and B_ij (both in MPa):

i description
    ...
i j A_ij B_ij

i, j: running indices (ignored by the program)
Note that the A and B matrices are symmetric.
