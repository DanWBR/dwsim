For this model, the parameter files are dummies, as the vtPR EOS
parameters are obtained from a group contribution model.

File "groups" contains the defined groups and their Q factors (effective
surface areas), followed by the interaction parameters a, b, c
(interaction parameter, linear and quadratic temperature coefficient):

i Q description
    ...
i j a b c

i, j: running indices (ignored by the program)
Note that always entries for the groups i & j as well as j & i must be
provided.

The actual "groups" are based on the work of B. Schmid, whereas the older
version used coefficients of Ahlert.
