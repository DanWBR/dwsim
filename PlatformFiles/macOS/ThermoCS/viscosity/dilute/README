Coefficients of the correlation function for dilute-gas viscosities
(standard correlation)

eta0 = Sum dg[i] x^i   with x = (T / Tc)^0.25

Tc:	critical temperature (may be different from the value listed
	with EOS parameters)
dg[i]:	with i = 0 ... 4: parameters in (Pa s)

Statistical thermodynamics predicts that the dilute gas viscosity
should be zero at 0 K, and become a linear function of temperature
at very high temperatures (i.e., dg[0] = 0, d[4] > 0). For most substances,
however, neither very low nor very high reduced temperatures are attainable,
so that correlations with dg[0] != 0 and dg[4] = 0 may be more practical.

Hydrogen requires a more complicated correlation.
