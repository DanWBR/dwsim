Ideas for extensions to SwarmOps:

- Add State-class which is persistent and used for holding
  the state of an optimizer and problem. An optimizer-object
  created with a state-object resumes execution, and if the
  state-object is not supplied then execution is started again.
  A state-object can also be created by supplying a position
  in the search-space and a radius so that all agents are
  initialized in a limited region of the search-space holding
  a known good solution. This can be used for chaining optimization
  of e.g. first PS, then PSO, then DE, then LUS.
- Add namespaces SwarmOps.MultiObjective and .SingleObjective
- Add multi-objective optimizers NSGA-II, MO-GA, MO-DE
