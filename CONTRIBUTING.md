# Contributor License Agreement

You must sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before your Pull Request will be merged. You can read more about [Contribution License Agreements (CLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) on Wikipedia.

The agreement: [DWSIM Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/DanWBR/229c25458e596ef9c778c0301cf52fc3)

You don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual. When your pull-request is created, it is classified by a CLA bot. If the change is trivial (for example, you just fixed a typo), then the PR is labelled with cla-not-required. Otherwise it's classified as cla-required. Once you signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labelled as cla-signed.

## Code Copyrights

The DWSIM project maintains that all code copyrights are held by the original author(s), but licensed back, under GPLv3, to the greater community of users.

## Source License

The DWSIM project uses the following license:

* The [General Public License Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)

## Copying Files from Other Projects

At times DWSIM may use some files from other projects, typically where a binary distribution does not exist or would be inconvenient to use.

The following rules must be followed for any code contributions that include files from another project:

* The license of the file is [permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence).
* The license of the file is left intact.
* The contribution is correctly attributed in the `third party notices`(e.g. NOTICES) file in the repository to which it is being contributed.

## Porting Files from Other Projects

There may be times in which code developed in other languages could benefit DWSIM. The rules for porting say a Java file to C# or VB, are the same as would be used for copying the same file, as described above.
