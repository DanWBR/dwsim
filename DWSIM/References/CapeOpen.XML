            The three types of port: material, energy and

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>As illustration, we remind requirements coming from the existing interface 
            specification and being connected with the Identification concept:</para>
            <para>The Unit Operations Interfaces have the following requirements:</para>
            <para>* If a flowsheet contains two instances of a Unit Operation of a particular 
            class, the COSE needs to provide the user a textual identifier to distinguish each 
            of the instances. For instance, when the COSE requires to report about an error 
            occurred in one of the Unit Operations.</para>
            <para>* When the COSE shows the user its GUI to connect the COSE’s streams to the 
            Unit Operation ports, the COSE needs to request the Unit for its list of available 
            ports. For the user to identify the ports, the user needs some distinctive textual 
            information for each of them.</para>
            <para>* When the COSE exposes to the user its interfaces to browse or set the 
            value of an internal parameter of a Unit Operation, the COSE needs to request the 
            Unit for its list of available parameters. No matter if this COSE’s interface is 
            a GUI or a programming interface, each parameter must be identified by a textual 
            string.</para>
            <para>The ICapeThermoMaterialObject (used by both Unit and Thermo interfaces):</para>
            <para>* If a Unit Operation has encountered an error accessing a stream 
            (<see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterialObject">ICapeThermoMaterialObject</see>), the 
            Unit might decide to report it to the user. It would be desirable the stream to 
            have a textual identifier for the user to be able to quickly know which stream 
            failed.</para>
            <para>The Thermodynamic Interfaces have the following requirements:</para>
            <para>* The <see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoSystem">ICapeThermoSystem</see>
            and the <see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoPropertyPackage">ICapeThermoPropertyPackage</see> 
            interfaces don’t require an identification interface, since both of them have been 
            designed as singletons (a single instance of each component class is required). 
            That means that there is no need to identify this instance: its class description 
            would be enough. However, the user might decide anyway to assign a name or a 
            description to the CAPE-OPEN property systems or property packages used in her/his 
            flowsheet. Furthermore, if these interfaces evolve, the singleton approach could 
            be removed. In this case, identifying each instance will be a must.</para>
            <para>The Solvers Interfaces have the following requirements:</para>
            <para>* Many objects should provide the functionality coming from the 
            Identification Common Interface.</para>
            <para>The SMST Interfaces have the following requirements:</para>
            <para>* The CO SMST component package depends on the Identification Interface 
            package. The interface ICapeSMSTFactory must provide the Identification 
            capabilities.</para>

            This is the abstract base class for all .Net based CAPE-OPEN exception classes.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            One of the principal advantages of .NET over COM is the additional information 
            included in exception handling. In COM, exceptions were handled through returning 
            an HRESULT value, which is an integer that indicated whether the function call had
            successfully returned (Rogerson, 1997). Because the HRESULT value was a 32-bit 
            integer, it could indicate more information than simply success or failure, but it
            was limited in that it did not include descriptive information about the exception
            that occurred.</para>
            <para>Under .NET, an application exception class is available 
            (System.ApplicationException) that can be used to provide information such as a message and the source 
            of the exception. The CAPE-OPEN exception definitions all derive from an 
            ECapeRoot interface (Belaud et al, 2001). In the current implementation of the 
            CAPE-OPEN exception classes, all exception classes derive from the 
            CapeUserException class, which itself is derived from the .NET 
            System.ApplicationException class. The CapeUserException class exposes the 
            <see c = "ECapeRoot"/> and <see c = "ECapeUser"/> interfaces. In this way, 
            all exceptions that are raised by the process modeling components can be caught 
            either as a CapeRootException or as a System.ApplicationException in addition to 
            being caught as the derived exception type. </para>

            <para>
            The CAPE-OPEN object model is based upon Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM).
            Computer security practices have evolved to incorporate the principle of least priviledge,
            where users rights on the computer are reduced. This protects various high-risk portions
            of the system, such as the Windows registry, from attack. The disadvantage of least priviledges
            and registry restriction is that it makes development and depolyment of COM-based PMCs difficult
            because the local user is unable to install and register the components. 
            </para>
            <para>
            This class utilizes various .Net file location schemes to enable users to develop and
            deploy new unit operation PMCs on their machine under the restrictions imposed by 
            least priviledges. In particular, it can detect if the debugger is attached and can identifiy 
            the assembly being debugged, making it available in the debugger to check the progress of
            the unit. Further, it creates and uses a "CapeOpen Objects" directory located in the current user's 
            %ProgramFiles%\CommonFiles directory. Subdirectories under this directory are also inspected.

            <para>

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>When a PME requires some kind of functionality, with the help of the 
            CAPE-OPEN categories, the user is able to select and create a CO class which 
            will expose the required CO interfaces. There is the need for the PME to 
            exchange some information with this instance of the PMC. This information 
            consists in a set of simple unrelated functionalities that will be useful for 
            any kind of CAPE-OPEN component, since they will allow maximum integration 
            between clients and servers. All these functionalities can be grouped in a 
            single interface. Some of the functionalities to fulfil consist in exchanging 
            interface references between the PMC and the PME. Instead of adding these 
            properties to each business interfaces, it is much more convenient to
            add them to a single common interface which refers to the whole PMC.</para>
            <para>Furthermore, there is a need for getting parameters, editing and 
            lifecycling.</para>
            <para>The interface should fulfil the following requirements:</para>
            <para>Parameters:</para>
            <para>So far, only Unit Operations can expose their public parameters, through 
            property ICapeUnit.parameters, which returns a collection of parameters. This 
            property allows COSEs to support design specs between two CAPE-OPEN Unit 
            Operations. That means that the CAPE-OPEN interfaces are powerful enough to 
            allow that the design spec of a given Unit Operation (exposed through public 
            parameters) depends on transformations of public parameters exposed by other 
            CAPE-OPEN Unit Operations. If also other components, such as Material Object, 
            would be able to expose public parameters, the functionality the aforementioned 
            described functionality could be extended. Other functionalities would be:
            </para>
            <para>(i) allowing optimizers to use a public variable exposed by any 
            CAPE-OPEN component.</para>
            <para>(ii) Allow performing regression on the interaction parameters of a 
            CAPE-OPEN Property Package.</para>
            <para>Centralising the property that accesses these collections in a single 
            entry point, helps to clarify the life cycle usage standards for these 
            collections. That means that it will be easier for the PMC clients to know 
            how often they have to check whether the contents of these collections have 
            changed (although the collection object will be valid until the PMC is 
            destroyed). Setting general rules for the usage of these collections makes 
            the business interface specifications more regular and simpler. Obviously, 
            since too general rules may reduce flexibility, PMC specifications might point
            out exceptions to the general rule. Let’s see how would this affect the 
            particular PMC specifications:</para>
            <para>Simulation context:</para>
            <para>So far, most of CAPE-OPEN interfaces have been designed to allow a 
            client to access the functionality of a CAPE-OPEN component. Since clients 
            will often be Simulation Environment, CAPE-OPEN components would benefit from 
            using functionality provided by their client, a COSE for instance. These 
            services provided by any PMEs are defined within the Simulation Context COSE 
            Interface specification document.</para>
            <para>The following interfaces are designed:</para>
            <para>(i) Thermo Material Template Systems: Theses interface allows a PMC to 
            choose between all the Thermo Material factories supported by the PME. These 
            factories will allow the PMC to create a thermo material object associated to 
            the elected Property Package (which can be CAPE-OPEN or not).</para>
            <para>(ii) Diagnostics: This interface will allow to integrate seamlessly the 
            diagnostics messages generated by any PMC with the mechanisms supported by

            <para>(iii) COSEUtilities: In the same idea of this specification document, 
            PME has also its own utilities interface in order to gather many basic 
            operations. For instance that allows the PME to supply a list of standardised 
            values.</para>
            <para>Edit:</para>
            <para>The Edit method defined by the UNIT specification proved to be very useful in 
            order to provide Graphical User Interface (GUI) capabilities highly customized 
            to each type of UNIT implementation. There’s no reason why other PMCs could 
            not benefit of this capability. Obviously, when a PMC provides Edit 
            functionality, being able to persist its state is a desired requirements, to 
            prevent the user from having to repeatedly reconfigure the PMC.</para>
            <para>LifeCycle:</para>
            <para>There is probably no strict necessity to expose directly initialization 
            nor destruction functions, since these should be invoked automatically by the 
            used middleware (COM/CORBA). That is, the initialization could be performed 
            in the constructor of the class and the destroy in its destructor. However, 
            in some cases the client could need to invoke them explicitly. For example, 
            all actions that could fail should be invoked by these methods. If these 
            actions were places in the constructor or destructor, potential failures 
            would cause memory leak, and they would be difficult to track, since it would 
            not be clear if the component has been created/destroyed or not. Examples of 
            cases where they are useful:</para>
            <para>(i) Initialize: The client might need to initialize a given set of PMC 
            in a specific order, in case that there are dependencies between them. Some 
            PMC may be wrappers to other components, or may need an external file to get 
            initialized. This initialization process may often fail, or the user may even 
            decide to cancel it. Moving these actions from the class constructor to the 
            initialize method allows communicating the client that the construction of
            the component must be aborted in some cases.</para>
            <para>(ii) Destructors: The PMC primary object should destroy here all its secondary 
            objects. Relying on the native destructor could cause deadlocks when loop 
            references exist between PMC objects. See in the example diagram below that 
            after the client releases its reference to the Unit Operation, both the Unit 
            and the Parameter are being used by another objects. So, without an explicit 
            terminate method, none of them would be ever terminated.</para>

             mechanisms, it is much preferable to redirect them all to the PME services for
             communicating with the user. The Error Common Interfaces do not fulfil these requirements,
             since they stop the execution of the PMC code and signal an abnormal situation to the PME.

            may be a clash between different FORTRAN modules if two of them select the same output 
            channel for FORTRAN messaging. Hence the PME should centralise the generation of
            unique output channels for each PMC that may require them. This requirement only occurs
            when PME and PMC belong to the same computing process, obviously this FORTRAN
            channel functionality is only applicable when the architecture is not distributed. As we can
            have in the future this kind of information to exchange, a generic and extensible mechanism
            has to be set up. The calling pattern is a good candidate. Thus a specific string value for
            FORTRAN channel would be standardised.

            Performs US EPA Waste Reduction (WAR) algorithm calculation on a flowsheet accessed using the 
            <see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeFlowsheetMonitoring"/> interface.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            The WAR plug-in works by directly access the unit operations and material flows within the flowsheet. 
            Once the WAR plug-in has been instantiated by the flowsheeting environment, in this case, COFE, the WAR 
            plug-in is initialized and provided with a reference to the flowsheet monitoring interface enabling the 
            plug-in to directly access the flowsheet’s unit operation and stream collections. The flowsheet 
            monitoring interface is one of the features of the simulation context provided by COFE to the WAR 
            plug-in.</para>
            <para>
            Upon activation, the WAR plug-in enumerates all of the unit operations and streams contained within the 
            flowsheet using the flowsheet monitoring interface. First, the plug-in places references to the streams 
            in two stream collections, separate input and output stream collections. The unit operations in the unit
            operation collection are queried for inlet and outlet ports. The streams connected to these ports are 
            matched against the streams in the input and/or output stream collections. Streams that are attached to 
            input ports for a unit operation are then removed from the output stream collections as the no longer 
            leave the process. Likewise, streams that are attached to an outlet port are removed from the input 
            stream collection as they originate within the process. That is, streams not connected to any unit 
            operation outlet port are considered feed streams, and streams that are not connected to any unit
            operation inlet port are considered output streams. An exception to this rule is that some PMEs utilize 
            “source” unit operations that only have a single outlet stream and no inlet streams. These units are 
            considered to be feed units, and the stream connected to it is considered to be a feed stream. 
            Analogously, unit operations that have only a single inlet port and no outlet ports are considered to 
            be product units; the streams connected to it are considered to be product streams.
            </para>
            <para>This plug-in also allows users to select only portions of the flowsheet for a WAR analysis. This 
            is accomplished by having the user select the unit operations of interest. The feed and product stream 
            algorithms for a sub-set of the total unit operation collection are similar to the algorithm described 
            above for the total flowsheet. 
            </para>
            <para>Once the feed and product streams have been identified, the plug-in performs its WAR calculation. 
            The specific PEI, ψ<sub>(k,i)</sub><sup>S</sup>, for each chemical is calculated by averaging the impact category scores 
            for all the chemicals in the database and normalizing by dividing the chemical’s score by the average 
            value. Once the normalized ψ<sub>(k,i)</sub><sup>S</sup> has been calculated, the PEI generated by the 
            process, İ<sub>gen</sub>, is calculated using the normalized value of ψ<sub>(k,i)</sub><sup>S</sup> for 
            the individual categories, category weighting factor mass flow rates and the concentration of the 
            chemical of each stream. The plug-in allows the user to designate product streams and account for 
            energy usage in the WAR algorithm.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            GetReactionParameters returns a collection of CAPE-OPEN parameters [6] that 
            characterize the rate expression used by the reaction model in a Reaction Package. 
            For a PowerLaw model this collection would contain parameters for activation energy, 
            pre-exponential factor and compound exponents for example. It is up to the Reactions 
            Package implementor to decide whether a client can update the values of these 
            parameters. If this operation is allowed, then the implementor must also provide 
            support for persistence [5] interfaces, so that the updated values can be saved and 
            restored. In this case the COSE is also responsible for calling the persistence
            methods.
            </para>
            <para>
            Deliberately, the standard does not define the names of the parameters that may 
            appear in such a collection, even for well-known reaction models, such as PowerLaw 
            and Langmuir – Hinshelwood – Hougen – Watson (LHHW). This is because the formulation 
            of well-known models is not fixed, and because the standard needs to support custom 
            models as well as the well-known models. 
            </para>
            <para>
            This decision is not expected to be restrictive: in most cases the (software) client 
            of a Reactions Package does not need to know what model the package implements and 
            what parameters it has. However, the parameters may be of interest to an end-user who 
            wants to adjust or estimate the parameter values. In these cases the COSE can invoke 
            the Reaction Package’s own GUI, or, if it doesn’t have one, present the parameters in 
            a generic grid. It is the Reaction Package implementor’s responsibility to provide 
            documentation for the parameters so that an enduser can understand how they are used.

            <para>
            Since this class utilizes a generic collection class, .Net based objects can obtain

            <para>The aim of the Collection interface is to give a CAPE-OPEN component 
            the possibility to expose a list of objects to any client of the component. 
            The client will not be able to modify the collection, i.e. removing, 
            replacing or adding elements. However, since the client will have access to 
            any CAPE-OPEN interface exposed by the items of the collection, it will be 
            able to modify the state of any element.</para>
            <para>CAPE-OPEN Collections don’t allow exposing basic types such as 
            numerical values or strings. Indeed, using CapeArrays is more convenient

            <para>Not all the items of a collection must belong to the same class. It is 
            enough if they implement the same interface or set of interfaces. A CAPE-OPEN

            identified by its actual name (e.g. type CapeString) or by its position 
            in the collection (e.g. type CapeLong). The name of an element is the 
            value returned by the ComponentName() method of its ICapeIdentification 
            interface. The advantage of retrieving an item by name rather than by 
            position is that it is much more efficient. This is because it is faster 
            to check all names from the server part than checking then from the

             Calculation method for the MixerExample unit operation.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             A mixer unit operation combined the material flows from two inlet ports into the flow of a single outlet port.
             In order to do this calculation, the mixer unit obtains flow information from each inlet port,
             the adds the flows to obtain the flow of the outlet port. In the case of the mixer below, it is assumed that the
             components are the same in each material object and that the components are listed in the same order.
             After the combined flow is calculated at the values set to the outlet port, along with the 
             enthalpy of the stream calculated from an energy balance and the pressure determined from
             the inlet pressures, the outlet stream can be flahsed to determine equilibrium conditions.
             The last task is releasing any duplicate material objects obtained.
             </remarks>
             <example>
             <para>An example of how to calculate a unit operation. This method obtains material objects 
             from each of ports using the <see cref="T:CapeOpen.PortCollection"/> class. The <see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterialObject"/>
             interface is used to obtain the names using the CompIds() method, flows of each of the 
             components present in the material object, overall pressure and overall enthalpy are
             obtained using the <see cref="M:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterialObject.GetProp(System.String,System.String,System.Object,System.String,System.String)"/> method. The overall enthalpy of the stram is 
             calculated using <see cref="M:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterialObject.CalcProp(System.Object,System.Object,System.String)"/> method. The unit then combines the flows, 
             calculates the output stream enthalpy, and determines output pressure from the lower of 
             the two streams' pressure and pressure drop parameter. Lastly, the results of the 
             calculations are applied to the output material object using the <see cref="M:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterialObject.SetProp(System.String,System.String,System.Object,System.String,System.String,System.Object)"/> 
             method. The last method of the calculate method is to call the material's

             <para>
             In this case, the inlet materials need to be released. This is accomplished using the
             <see cref="M:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(System.Object)"/> method.
             Using this method to release the outlet material object would result in an null object reference error.

            <remarks>
            <para>A Simple Properties Package (SPP) is a complete, consistent, reusable, ready-to-use collection of 
            methods, chemical components and model parameters for calculating any of a set of known properties for
            the phases of a multiphase system. It includes all the pure component methods and data, together with 
            the relevant mixing rules and interaction parameters. A package normally covers only a small subset of 
            the chemical components and methods accessible through a Properties System. It is thus established by 
            selecting methods etc from within a larger system, possibly adding to or replacing these methods by 
            third party components.
            </para> 
            <para>These additional methods will normally be CAPE-OPEN compliant methods which may have been specially 
            written, or may come from another properties system. (They can only come from another system where that 
            system provides them as CAPE-OPEN compliant components). A Properties Package may be a Simple 
            Properties Package, or at a vendors discretion, made up from Option Sets (see definition of Option Set).

            <para>In order to identify the components of a Property Package, the 
            Executive will use the ‘casno’ argument instead of the compIds. The reason is 
            that different COSEs may give different names to the same chemical compounds, 
            whereas CAS Numbers are universal. Nevertheless, GetProp/SetProp... will still 
            require their compIds argument to have the usual contents ("hydrogen",
            "methane",...). Be aware that some simulators may have a limitation on the 
            length of the names for pure components. Hence, it is recommended that each 
            identifier returned by the compIds argument should not contain more than 8 
            characters. See notes on Description of component constants for more 
            information.</para>
            <para>If the package does not return a value for the ‘casno’ argument, or its 
            value is not recognised by the Executive, then the compIds will be interpreted 
            as the component’s English name: such as "benzene", "water",... Obviously, it 
            is recommended to provide a value for the casno argument.</para>
            <para>The same information can also be extracted using the 
            ICapeThermoPropertyPackage GetComponentConstant method, using the 
            casRegistryNumber property identifier.</para>

            <summary>
            Returns Phase labels for the Phases that are currently present in the 
            Material Object.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            This method is intended to work in conjunction with the SetPresentPhases 
            method. Together these methods provide a means of communication between a 
            PME (or another client) and an Equilibrium Calculator (or other component 
            that implements the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface). The following 
            sequence of operations is envisaged.
            </para>
            <para>1. Prior to requesting an Equilibrium Calculation, a PME will use the 
            SetPresentPhases method to define a list of Phases that may be considered in 
            the Equilibrium Calculation. Typically, this is necessary because an 
            Equilibrium Calculator may be capable of handling a large number of Phases 
            but for a particular application, it may be known that only certain Phases 
            will be involved. For example, if the complete Phase list contains Phases 
            with the following labels (with the obvious interpretation): vapour, 
            hydrocarbonLiquid and aqueousLiquid and it is required to model a liquid 
            decanter, the present Phases might be set to hydrocarbonLiquid and 
            aqueousLiquid.</para>
            <para>2. The GetPresentPhases method is then used by the CalcEquilibrium 
            method of the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface to obtain the list 
            of Phase labels corresponding to the Phases that may be present at 
            equilibrium.</para>
            <para>3. The Equilibrium Calculation determines which Phases actually 
            co-exist at equilibrium. This list of Phases may be a sub-set of the Phases 
            considered because some Phases may not be present at the prevailing 
            conditions. For example, if the amount of water is sufficiently small the 
            aqueousLiquid Phase in the above example may not exist because all the water 
            dissolves in the hydrocarbonLiquid Phase.</para>
            <para>4. The CalcEquilibrium method uses the SetPresentPhases method to indicate 
            the Phases present following the equilibrium calculation (and sets the phase 
            properties).</para>
            <para>5. The PME uses the GetPresentPhases method to find out the Phases present 
            following the calculation and it can then use the GetSinglePhaseProp or 
            GetTPFraction methods to get the Phase properties.</para>
            <para>To indicate that a Phase is ‘present’ in a Material Object (or other 
            component that implements the ICapeThermoMaterial interface) it must be 
            specified by the SetPresentPhases method of the ICapeThermoMaterial 
            interface. Even if a Phase is present, it does not imply that any Physical 
            Properties are actually set unless the phaseStatus is Cape_AtEquilibrium 
            or Cape_Estimates (see below). </para>
            <para>If no Phases are present, UNDEFINED should be returned for both the 
            phaseLabels and phaseStatus arguments.</para>
            <para>The phaseStatus argument contains as many entries as there are Phase 
            labels. The valid settings are listed in the following table:</para>
            <para>Cape_UnknownPhaseStatus - This is the normal setting when a Phase is
            specified as being available for an Equilibrium Calculation.</para>
            <para>Cape_AtEquilibrium - The Phase has been set as present as a result of 
            an Equilibrium Calculation.</para>
            <para> Cape_Estimates - Estimates of the equilibrium state have been set in 
            the Material Object.</para>
            <para>All the Phases with a status of Cape_AtEquilibrium have values of 
            temperature, pressure, composition and Phase fraction set that correspond 
            to an equilibrium state, i.e. equal temperature, pressure and fugacities of 
            each Compound. Phases with a Cape_Estimates status have values of temperature,
            pressure, composition and Phase fraction set in the Material Object. These 
            values are available for use by an Equilibrium Calculator component to 
            initialise an Equilibrium Calculation. The stored values are available but 
            there is no guarantee that they will be used.
            </para>
            <para>
            Using the ClearAllProps method results in a Material Object that is in 
            the same state as when it was first created. It is an alternative to using 
            the CreateMaterial method but it is expected to have a smaller overhead in 
            operating system resources.

            Components that implement this method must get the input specification for the

            <para>A typical sequence of operations for CalcTwoPhaseProp when implemented by

            <para>- Check that the phaseLabels specified are valid.</para>
            <para>- Use the GetTPFraction method (of the Material Object specified in the

            <para>- Store values for the properties in the Material Object using the 
            SetTwoPhaseProp method of the ICapeThermoMaterial interface.</para>
            <para>CalcTwoPhaseProp will request the values it requires from the Material Object 
            through GetTPFraction or GetSinglePhaseProp calls. If a requested property is 
            not available, the exception raised will be ECapeThrmPropertyNotAvailable. If 
            this error occurs, then the Property Package can return it to the client, or 
            request a different property. Material Object implementations must be able to 
            supply property values using the client choice of basis by implementing 
            conversion from one basis to another.</para>
            <para>Clients should not assume that Phase fractions and Compound fractions in 
            a Material Object are normalised. Fraction values may also lie outside the 
            range 0 to 1. If fractions are not normalised, or are outside the expected 
            range, it is the responsibility of the Property Package to decide how to deal 
            with the situation.</para>
            <para>It is recommended that properties are requested one at a time in order to 
            simplify error handling. However, it is recognised that there are cases where 
            the potential efficiency gains of requesting several properties simultaneously 
            are more important. One such example might be when a property and its 
            derivatives are required.</para>
            <para>If a client uses multiple properties in a call and one of them fails, then the 
            whole call should be considered to have failed. This implies that no value 
            should be written back to the Material Object by the Property Package until 
            it is known that the whole request can be satisfied.</para>
            <para>CalcTwoPhaseProp must be called separately for each combination of Phase
            groupings. For example, vapour-liquid K-values have to be calculated in a 
            separate call from liquid-liquid K-values.</para>
            <para>Two-phase properties may not be meaningful unless the temperatures and 
            pressures of all Phases are identical. It is the responsibility of the Property 
            Package to check such conditions and to raise an exception if appropriate.</para>
            <para>It is likely that a PME might request values of properties for Phases at

            necessary to retrieve the values of two specifications, for example the 
            pressure and temperature, for the Equilibrium Calculation. The CheckEquilibriumSpec 
            method can be used to check for supported specifications. Each specification 
            variable contains a sequence of strings in the order defined in the following 
            table (hence, the specification arguments may have 3 or 4 items):<para>
            <para>property identifier The property identifier can be any of the identifiers 
            listed in section 7.5.5 but only certain property specifications will normally 
            be supported by any Equilibrium Routine.</para>
            basis The basis for the property value. Valid settings for basis are given in 
            section 7.4. Use UNDEFINED as a placeholder for a property for which basis does
            not apply. For most Equilibrium Specifications, the result of the calculation
            is not dependent on the basis, but, for example, for phase fraction 
            specifications the basis (Mole or Mass) does make a difference.</para>
            <para>phase label The phase label denotes the Phase to which the specification 
            applies. It must either be one of the labels returned by GetPresentPhases, or 
            the special value “Overall”.</para>
            compound identifier (optional)The compound identifier allows for specifications 
            that depend on a particular Compound. This item of the specification array is 
            optional and may be omitted. In case of a specification without compound 
            identifier, the array element may be present and empty, or may be absent.</para>
            <para>Some examples of typical phase equilibrium specifications are given in 
            the table below.</para>
            <para>The values corresponding to the specifications in the argument list and 
            the overall composition of the mixture must be set in the associated Material 
            Object before a call to CalcEquilibrium.</para>
            <para>Components such as a Property Package or an Equilibrium Calculator must 
            implement the ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface, so that an 
            ICapeThermoMaterial interface can be passed via the SetMaterial method. It is 
            the responsibility of the implementation of CalcEquilibrium to validate the 
            Material Object before attempting a calculation.</para>
            <para>The Phases that will be considered in the Equilibrium Calculation are 
            those that exist in the Material Object, i.e. the list of phases specified in 
            a SetPresentPhases call. This provides a way for a client to specify whether, 
            for example, a vapour-liquid, liquid-liquid, or vapourliquid-liquid calculation 
            is required. CalcEquilibrium must use the GetPresentPhases method to retrieve 
            the list of Phases and the associated Phase status flags. The Phase status 
            flags may be used by the client to provide information about the Phases, for 
            example whether estimates of the equilibrium state are provided. See the 
            description of the GetPresentPhases and SetPresentPhases methods of the 
            ICapeThermoMaterial interface for details. When the Equilibrium Calculation 
            has been completed successfully, the SetPresentPhases method must be used to 
            specify which Phases are present at equilibrium and the Phase status flags for 
            the phases should be set to Cape_AtEquilibrium. This must include any Phases 
            that are present in zero amount such as the liquid Phase in a dew point 
            calculation.</para>
            <para>Some types of Phase equilibrium specifications may result in more than 
            one solution. A common example of this is the case of a dew point calculation. 
            However, CalcEquilibrium can provide only one solution through the Material 
            Object. The solutionType argument allows the “Normal” or “Retrograde” solution 
            to be explicitly requested. When none of the specifications includes a phase 
            fraction, the solutionType argument should be set to “Unspecified”.</para>
            <para>The definition of “Normal” is</para>
            <para>where V F is the vapour phase fraction and the derivatives are at 
            equilibrium states. For “Retrograde” behaviour,</para>
            <para>CalcEquilibrium must set the amounts, compositions, temperature and 
            pressure for all Phases present at equilibrium, as well as the temperature and 
            pressure for the overall mixture if not set as part of the calculation 
            specifications. CalcEquilibrium must not set any other Physical Properties.</para>
            <para>As an example, the following sequence of operations might be performed 
            by CalcEquilibrium in the case of an Equilibrium Calculation at fixed pressure 
            and temperature:</para>
            <para>- With the ICapeThermoMaterial interface of the supplied Material Object:
            </para>
            <para>- Use the GetPresentPhases method to find the list of Phases that the 
            Equilibrium Calculation should consider.</para>
            <para>- With the ICapeThermoCompounds interface of the Material Object use the
            GetCompoundIds method to find which Compounds are present.</para>
            <para>- Use the GetOverallProp method to get the temperature, pressure and 
            composition for the overall mixture.</para>
            <para>- Perform the Equilibrium Calculation.</para>
            <para>- Use SetPresentPhases to specify the Phases present at equilibrium and 
            set the Phase status flags to Cape_AtEquilibrium.</para>
            <para>- Use SetSinglePhaseProp to set pressure, temperature, Phase amount 
            (or Phase fraction) and composition for all Phases present.</para>

            <para>
            This method is intended to work in conjunction with the SetPresentPhases 
            method. Together these methods provide a means of communication between a 
            PME (or another client) and an Equilibrium Calculator (or other component 
            that implements the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface). The following 
            sequence of operations is envisaged.
            </para>
            <para>1. Prior to requesting an Equilibrium Calculation, a PME will use the 
            SetPresentPhases method to define a list of Phases that may be considered in 
            the Equilibrium Calculation. Typically, this is necessary because an 
            Equilibrium Calculator may be capable of handling a large number of Phases 
            but for a particular application, it may be known that only certain Phases 
            will be involved. For example, if the complete Phase list contains Phases 
            with the following labels (with the obvious interpretation): vapour, 
            hydrocarbonLiquid and aqueousLiquid and it is required to model a liquid 
            decanter, the present Phases might be set to hydrocarbonLiquid and 
            aqueousLiquid.</para>
            <para>2. The GetPresentPhases method is then used by the CalcEquilibrium 
            method of the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface to obtain the list 
            of Phase labels corresponding to the Phases that may be present at 
            equilibrium.</para>
            <para>3. The Equilibrium Calculation determines which Phases actually 
            co-exist at equilibrium. This list of Phases may be a sub-set of the Phases 
            considered because some Phases may not be present at the prevailing 
            conditions. For example, if the amount of water is sufficiently small the 
            aqueousLiquid Phase in the above example may not exist because all the water 
            dissolves in the hydrocarbonLiquid Phase.</para>
            <para>4. The CalcEquilibrium method uses the SetPresentPhases method to indicate 
            the Phases present following the equilibrium calculation (and sets the phase 
            properties).</para>
            <para>5. The PME uses the GetPresentPhases method to find out the Phases present 
            following the calculation and it can then use the GetSinglePhaseProp or 
            GetTPFraction methods to get the Phase properties.</para>
            <para>To indicate that a Phase is ‘present’ in a Material Object (or other 
            component that implements the ICapeThermoMaterial interface) it must be 
            specified by the SetPresentPhases method of the ICapeThermoMaterial 
            interface. Even if a Phase is present, it does not imply that any Physical 
            Properties are actually set unless the phaseStatus is Cape_AtEquilibrium 
            or Cape_Estimates (see below). </para>
            <para>If no Phases are present, UNDEFINED should be returned for both the 
            phaseLabels and phaseStatus arguments.</para>
            <para>The phaseStatus argument contains as many entries as there are Phase 
            labels. The valid settings are listed in the following table:</para>

             <para>Although the result of some calls to GetSinglePhaseProp may be a

            This must be one or more of the supported two-phase properties and derivatives 
            (as given by the GetTwoPhasePropList method). The standard identifiers for 
            two-phase properties are given in section 7.5.6 and 7.6.</param>

            <para>CalcTwoPhaseProp calculates the values of properties such as surface 
            tension or K-values. Properties that pertain to a single Phase are handled by 
            the CalcSinglePhaseProp method of the ICapeThermoPropertyRoutine interface.
            Components that implement this method must get the input specification for the 
            calculation (temperature, pressure and composition) from the associated 
            Material Object and set the results in the Material Object.</para>
            <para>Components such as a Property Package or Property Calculator must 
            implement the ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface so that an 
            ICapeThermoMaterial interface can be passed via the SetMaterial method.</para>
            <para>A typical sequence of operations for CalcTwoPhaseProp when implemented by
            a Property Package component would be:</para>
            <para>- Check that the phaseLabels specified are valid.</para>
            <para>- Use the GetTPFraction method (of the Material Object specified in the 
            last call to the SetMaterial method) to get the temperature, pressure and 
            composition of the specified Phases.</para>
            <para>- Calculate the properties.</para>
            <para>- Store values for the properties in the Material Object using the 
            SetTwoPhaseProp method of the ICapeThermoMaterial interface.</para>
            <para>CalcTwoPhaseProp will request the values it requires from the Material Object 
            through GetTPFraction or GetSinglePhaseProp calls. If a requested property is 
            not available, the exception raised will be ECapeThrmPropertyNotAvailable. If 
            this error occurs, then the Property Package can return it to the client, or 
            request a different property. Material Object implementations must be able to 
            supply property values using the client choice of basis by implementing 
            conversion from one basis to another.</para>
            <para>Clients should not assume that Phase fractions and Compound fractions in 
            a Material Object are normalised. Fraction values may also lie outside the 
            range 0 to 1. If fractions are not normalised, or are outside the expected 
            range, it is the responsibility of the Property Package to decide how to deal 
            with the situation.</para>
            <para>It is recommended that properties are requested one at a time in order to 
            simplify error handling. However, it is recognised that there are cases where 
            the potential efficiency gains of requesting several properties simultaneously 
            are more important. One such example might be when a property and its 
            derivatives are required.</para>
            <para>If a client uses multiple properties in a call and one of them fails, then the 
            whole call should be considered to have failed. This implies that no value 
            should be written back to the Material Object by the Property Package until 
            it is known that the whole request can be satisfied.</para>
            <para>CalcTwoPhaseProp must be called separately for each combination of Phase
            groupings. For example, vapour-liquid K-values have to be calculated in a 
            separate call from liquid-liquid K-values.</para>
            <para>Two-phase properties may not be meaningful unless the temperatures and 
            pressures of all Phases are identical. It is the responsibility of the Property 
            Package to check such conditions and to raise an exception if appropriate.</para>
            <para>It is likely that a PME might request values of properties for Phases at 
            conditions of temperature, pressure and composition where one or both of the 
            Phases do not exist (according to the mathematical/physical models used to 
            represent properties). The exception ECapeThrmPropertyNotAvailable may be 
            raised or an extrapolated value may be returned. It is responsibility of the

            has been completed successfully, the SetPresentPhases method must be used to 
            specify which Phases are present at equilibrium and the Phase status flags for 
            the phases should be set to Cape_AtEquilibrium. This must include any Phases 
            that are present in zero amount such as the liquid Phase in a dew point 
            calculation.</para>
            <para>Some types of Phase equilibrium specifications may result in more than 
            one solution. A common example of this is the case of a dew point calculation. 
            However, CalcEquilibrium can provide only one solution through the Material 
            Object. The solutionType argument allows the “Normal” or “Retrograde” solution 
            to be explicitly requested. When none of the specifications includes a phase 
            fraction, the solutionType argument should be set to “Unspecified”.</para>
            <para>The definition of “Normal” is</para>
            <para>where V F is the vapour phase fraction and the derivatives are at 
            equilibrium states. For “Retrograde” behaviour,</para>
            <para>CalcEquilibrium must set the amounts, compositions, temperature and 
            pressure for all Phases present at equilibrium, as well as the temperature and 
            pressure for the overall mixture if not set as part of the calculation 
            specifications. CalcEquilibrium must not set any other Physical Properties.</para>
            <para>As an example, the following sequence of operations might be performed 
            by CalcEquilibrium in the case of an Equilibrium Calculation at fixed pressure 
            and temperature:</para>
            <para>- With the ICapeThermoMaterial interface of the supplied Material Object:
            </para>
            <para>- Use the GetPresentPhases method to find the list of Phases that the 
            Equilibrium Calculation should consider.</para>
            <para>- With the ICapeThermoCompounds interface of the Material Object use the
            GetCompoundIds method to find which Compounds are present.</para>
            <para>- Use the GetOverallProp method to get the temperature, pressure and 
            composition for the overall mixture.</para>
            <para>- Perform the Equilibrium Calculation.</para>
            <para>- Use SetPresentPhases to specify the Phases present at equilibrium and 
            set the Phase status flags to Cape_AtEquilibrium.</para>
            <para>- Use SetSinglePhaseProp to set pressure, temperature, Phase amount 
            (or Phase fraction) and composition for all Phases present.</para>

             arguments and Compound constant Physical Properties, as specified in section

             <para>compIds - No equivalence. compIds is an artefact, which is assigned by 
             the component that implements the GetCompoundList method. This string will 
             normally contain a unique Compound identifier such as "benzene". It must be 
             used in all the arguments which are named “compIds” in the methods of the
            ICapeThermoCompounds and ICapeThermoMaterial interfaces.</para>

             <para>When the ICapeThermoCompounds interface is implemented by a Material 
             Object, the list of Compounds returned is fixed when the Material Object is 
             configured.</para>
             <para>For a Property Package component, the Property Package will normally 
             contain a limited set of Compounds selected for a particular application, 
             rather than all possible Compounds that could be available to a proprietary 
             Properties System.</para>
             <para>In order to identify the Compounds of a Property Package, the PME, or 
             other client, will use the casnos argument rather than the compIds. This is 
             because different PMEs may give different names to the same Compounds and the
             casnos is (almost always) unique. If the casnos is not available (e.g. for 
             petroleum fractions), or not unique, the other pieces of information returned 
             by GetCompoundList can be used to distinguish the Compounds. It should be 
             noted, however, that for communication with a Property Package a client must 
             use the Compound identifiers returned in the compIds argument.</para>

            This interface is optional and would be implemented by a port object. It is intended

            <para>As illustration, we remind requirements coming from the existing interface 
            specification and being connected with the Identification concept:</para>
            <para>The Unit Operations Interfaces have the following requirements:</para>
            <para>* If a flowsheet contains two instances of a Unit Operation of a particular 
            class, the COSE needs to provide the user a textual identifier to distinguish each 
            of the instances. For instance, when the COSE requires to report about an error 
            occurred in one of the Unit Operations.</para>
            <para>* When the COSE shows the user its GUI to connect the COSE’s streams to the 
            Unit Operation ports, the COSE needs to request the Unit for its list of available 
            ports. For the user to identify the ports, the user needs some distinctive textual 
            information for each of them.</para>
            <para>* When the COSE exposes to the user its interfaces to browse or set the 
            value of an internal parameter of a Unit Operation, the COSE needs to request the 
            Unit for its list of available parameters. No matter if this COSE’s interface is 
            a GUI or a programming interface, each parameter must be identified by a textual 
            string.</para>
            <para>The ICapeThermoMaterialObject (used by both Unit and Thermo interfaces):</para>
            <para>* If a Unit Operation has encountered an error accessing a stream 
            (<see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterialObject">ICapeThermoMaterialObject</see>), the 
            Unit might decide to report it to the user. It would be desirable the stream to 
            have a textual identifier for the user to be able to quickly know which stream 
            failed.</para>
            <para>The Thermodynamic Interfaces have the following requirements:</para>
            <para>* The <see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoSystem">ICapeThermoSystem</see>
            and the <see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoPropertyPackage">ICapeThermoPropertyPackage</see> 
            interfaces don’t require an identification interface, since both of them have been 
            designed as singletons (a single instance of each component class is required). 
            That means that there is no need to identify this instance: its class description 
            would be enough. However, the user might decide anyway to assign a name or a 
            description to the CAPE-OPEN property systems or property packages used in her/his 
            flowsheet. Furthermore, if these interfaces evolve, the singleton approach could 
            be removed. In this case, identifying each instance will be a must.</para>
            <para>The Solvers Interfaces have the following requirements:</para>
            <para>* Many objects should provide the functionality coming from the 
            Identification Common Interface.</para>
            <para>The SMST Interfaces have the following requirements:</para>
            <para>* The CO SMST component package depends on the Identification Interface 
            package. The interface ICapeSMSTFactory must provide the Identification 
            capabilities.</para>

            Calculation method for the CMixerExample110 unit operation.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            A mixer unit operation combined the material flows from two inlet ports into the flow of a single outlet port.
            In order to do this calculation, the mixer unit obtains flow information from each inlet port,
            the adds the flows to obtain the flow of the outlet port. In the case of the mixer below, it is assumed that the
            components are the same in each material object and that the components are listed in the same order.
            After the combined flow is calculated at the values set to the outlet port, along with the 
            enthalpy of the stream calculated from an energy balance and the pressure determined from
            the inlet pressures, the outlet stream can be flahsed to determine equilibrium conditions.
            The last task is releasing any duplicate material objects obtained.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>An example of how to calculate a unit operation. This method obtains material objects 
            from each of ports using the <see cref="T:CapeOpen.PortCollection"/> class. The <see cref="T:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterial"/>
            interface is used to obtain the names using the CompIds() method, flows of each of the 
            components present in the material object and overall pressure obtained using the 
            <see cref="M:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterial.GetOverallProp(System.String,System.String,System.Object@)"/> method. The enthaply of 
            each phase in the inlet materials is calculated using <see cref="M:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoPropertyRoutine.CalcSinglePhaseProp(System.Object,System.String)"/>
            method. The inlet enthalpy was multiplied by the phase flow (phase fraction * overall flow) 
            which was summed to determine the outlet stream enthalpy. 
            The output pressure from the lower of the two streams' pressure and pressure drop parameter. 
            Lastly, the results of the 
            calculations are applied to the output material object using the <see cref="M:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoMaterial.SetOverallProp(System.String,System.String,System.Object)"/> 
            method. The last method of the calculate method is to call the material's 
            <see cref="M:CapeOpen.ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine.CalcEquilibrium(System.Object,System.Object,System.String)"/> method.</para>

            In this case, the inlet materials need to be released. This is accomplished using the
            <see cref="M:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(System.Object)"/> method.
