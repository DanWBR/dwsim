<p>The Material Stream is used to represent matter which enters and leaves the limits of the
simulation, passing through the unit operations.</p>

<h3>Input Parameters</h3>

<b>Specification:</b>
<br>
One of the following flash types may be selected:
<ul>
   <li>Temperature and Pressure</li>
   <li>Pressure and Enthalpy</li>
   <li>Pressure and Entropy</li>
   <li>Pressure and Vapor Fraction</li>
   <li>Temperature and Vapor Fraction</li>
</ul> 

The above selection dictates which variables should be defined in order to enable DWSIM calculate the others:
<ul>
   <li><b>Temperature:</b> stream temperature</li>
   <li><b>Pressure:</b> stream pressure</li>
   <li><b>Specific Enthalpy:</b> stream&#8217;s specific enthalpy</li>
   <li><b>Specific Entropy:</b> stream&#8217;s specific entropy</li>
   <li><b>Molar Fraction (Vapor Phase):</b> the vapor phase mole fraction of the stream</li>
</ul>

<tr>

<td>
<b>Composition:</b><br>
The stream composition can be entered on basis of:
<ul>
   <li>Mole/Mass fraction/flow</li>
   <li>Standard liquid volumetric fraction</li>
   <li>Molality or molarity</li>
</ul> 

<em>The material stream composition can only be edited if the stream is not connected to any
unit operation upstream, which means that it doesn&#8217;t work as an output of any operation. If that is the
case, the stream configures itself as "read-only" and the user will not be able to edit any of
its properties directly. These are written into the stream as a result of calculation from its connected unit operation.</em>
<br><br>

For the mole/mass fraction basis options, the user must enter the composition in such a way
that the amounts sum up to 1. Regardless of the input basis option, new values are saved
only when the "Apply" button is pressed.<br><br>

Molarity and Molality input composition options only make sense in the context of an electrolyte
simulation. In this case, the solute amounts should be entered in moles and the solvent
amount in L (molarity) or kg (molality).<br><br>

<b>Flow:</b> One of the three types of flow (mass, molar or volumetric) must be given. 
The other two are calculated automatically in the case when temperature and pressure are already defined.
<br>If composition is defined by either mole or mass flow of each
component, the total flow of the stream is calculated automatically. If
a definition of composition is utilised, you will have to define
flowrate of the stream on stream level outside of composition dialog.

<h3>Calculation Method</h3>
When the four properties described above are defined, the material
stream is calculated and its properties are shown in the same window. The calculation sequence
for the material stream is the following:

<ul>
   <li>1. A flash calculation is done to know the component distribution between phases</li>
   <li>2. Properties of each phase are calculated individually</li>
   <li>3. Finally, the mixture properties are calculated</li>
</ul>

In the first step, a TP Flash is done by default, but it can be replaced by a PH flash if the
user defines this option in the simulation configuration window. When in "read-only" mode, the
stream properties are calculated according to parameters given by the upstream unit operation
(in the majority of cases, a TP flash is done as well).


<h3>Output parameters</h3>
The following items are calculated:<br>

<ol>
 <li>Component distribution between phases.<br>
     The compositions can be displayed either as molar or mass fraction by selecting the correspondent 
     option at <b>Composition basis</b> drop down field.<br><br>
 </li>

 <li>Phase properties:
   <ul>
      <li>specific enthalpy</li>
      <li>specific entropy</li>
      <li>molecular weight</li>
      <li>density</li>
      <li>volumetric flow rate @ T and P</li>
      <li>phase molar and mass fraction</li>
      <li>compressibility factor Z</li>
      <li>constant-pressure heat capacity (Cp)</li>
      <li>Cp/Cv</li>
      <li>thermal conductivity,</li>
      <li>surface tension (liquid phase only)</li>
      <li>kinematic viscosity</li>
      <li>dynamic viscosity</li>
      <li>Cp/Cv</li>

      <li>specific entropy</li>
      <li>molecular weight</li>
      <li>density</li>
      <li>thermal conductivity</li>
      <li> If the global setting &#8221;Calculate bubble and dew points at stream conditions&#8221; is activated, these are
           also shown in the &#8221;Mixture&#8221; properties section.</li>
