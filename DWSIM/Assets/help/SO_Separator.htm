<p>The separator vessel (also known as flash drum) is used to separate liquid phases
from vapor in a mixed material stream.</p>

<h3>Input Parameters</h3>
<b>Pressure downstream:</b>
This option defines which pressure (minimum, maximum or average) will be calculated 
if inlet streams feature different pressures. <br><br>


<b>Override separation temperature and pressure:</b> these properties define if the flash calculation
will be done with the temperature and pressure of the inlet stream or the ones defined
by the user.<br>
<br>

<em>The utilization of different temperatures and pressures from the inlet stream unbalance the
simulation in terms of energy!</em>

<h3>Calculation Method </h3>
There may be up to six inlet streams connected to the separator vessel. These streams are mixed internally prior to 
further calculations.<br>
The separator vessel just divides the inlet stream phases into two or three distinct streams. 
There is one vapour phase and up to two liquid phases possible. If two different liquids are detected the lighter phase
with lower density is sent to the upper "liquid outlet" and the heavier phase to "liquid outlet (2)".
<br><br>
If the user defines values for the separation temperature and/or pressure,
a TP Flash is done in the new conditions before the distribution of phases through the outlet
streams.

<h3>Output Parameters</h3>
There are no output parameters for this object.
