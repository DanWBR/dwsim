Preamble</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The GNU General 
Public License is a free, copyleft license for<BR>software and other kinds of 
works.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The licenses 
for most software and other practical works are designed<BR>to take away your 
freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<BR>the GNU General 
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<BR>share and change all 
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<BR>software for all its 
users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<BR>GNU General Public 
License for most of our software; it applies also to<BR>any other work released 
this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<BR>your programs, 
too.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; When we speak 
of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.&nbsp; Our General 
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>them if you wish), that 
you receive source code or can get it if you<BR>want it, that you can change the 
software or use pieces of it in new<BR>free programs, and that you know you can 
do these things.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To protect your 
rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<BR>these rights or asking you 
to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<BR>certain responsibilities 
if you distribute copies of the software, or if<BR>you modify it: 
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; For example, if 
you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you 
must pass on to the recipients the same<BR>freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You 
must make sure that they, too, receive<BR>or can get the source code.&nbsp; And 
you must show them these terms so they<BR>know their rights.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Developers that 
use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<BR>(1) assert copyright on 
the software, and (2) offer you this License<BR>giving you legal permission to 
copy, distribute and/or modify it.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; For the 
developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<BR>that there is 
no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<BR>authors' sake, 
the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<BR>changed, so that their 
problems will not be attributed erroneously to<BR>authors of previous 
versions.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Some devices 
are designed to deny users access to install or run<BR>modified versions of the 
software inside them, although the manufacturer<BR>can do so.&nbsp; This is 
fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<BR>protecting users' freedom to 
change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<BR>pattern of such abuse occurs in the 
area of products for individuals to<BR>use, which is precisely where it is most 
unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<BR>have designed this version of the GPL to 
prohibit the practice for those<BR>products.&nbsp; If such problems arise 
substantially in other domains, we<BR>stand ready to extend this provision to 
those domains in future versions<BR>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom 
of users.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Finally, every 
program is threatened constantly by software patents.<BR>States should not allow 
patents to restrict development and use of<BR>software on general-purpose 
computers, but in those that do, we wish to<BR>avoid the special danger that 
patents applied to a free program could<BR>make it effectively 
proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<BR>patents cannot be 
used to render the program non-free.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The precise 
terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification

Definitions.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; "This License" 
refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; "Copyright" 
also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<BR>works, such as 
semiconductor masks.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; "The Program" 
refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<BR>License.&nbsp; Each 
licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<BR>"recipients" may be 
individuals or organizations.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To "modify" a 
work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<BR>in a fashion 
requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<BR>exact copy.&nbsp; 
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<BR>earlier work or a 
work "based on" the earlier work.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A "covered 
work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<BR>on the 
Program.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To "propagate" 
a work means to do anything with it that, without<BR>permission, would make you 
directly or secondarily liable for<BR>infringement under applicable copyright 
law, except executing it on a<BR>computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; 
Propagation includes copying,<BR>distribution (with or without modification), 
making available to the<BR>public, and in some countries other activities as 
well.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To "convey" a 
work means any kind of propagation that enables other<BR>parties to make or 
receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<BR>a computer 
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; An interactive 
user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<BR>to the extent that it 
includes a convenient and prominently visible<BR>feature that (1) displays an 
appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<BR>tells the user that there is no 
warranty for the work (except to the<BR>extent that warranties are provided), 
that licensees may convey the<BR>work under this License, and how to view a copy 
of this License.&nbsp; If<BR>the interface presents a list of user commands or 
options, such as a<BR>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this 
criterion.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 1. Source 
Code.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The "source 
code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<BR>for making 
modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<BR>form of a 
work.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A "Standard 
Interface" means an interface that either is an official<BR>standard defined by 
a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<BR>interfaces specified for a 
particular programming language, one that<BR>is widely used among developers 
working in that language.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The "System 
Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<BR>than the work as a 
whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<BR>packaging a Major 
Component, but which is not part of that Major<BR>Component, and (b) serves only 
to enable use of the work with that<BR>Major Component, or to implement a 
Standard Interface for which an<BR>implementation is available to the public in 
source code form.&nbsp; A<BR>"Major Component", in this context, means a major 
essential component<BR>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific 
operating system<BR>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler 
used to<BR>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run 
it.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The 
"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<BR>the source 
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<BR>work) run the object 
code and to modify the work, including scripts to<BR>control those 
activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<BR>System Libraries, 
or general-purpose tools or generally available free<BR>programs which are used 
unmodified in performing those activities but<BR>which are not part of the 
work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<BR>includes interface definition 
files associated with source files for<BR>the work, and the source code for 
shared libraries and dynamically<BR>linked subprograms that the work is 
specifically designed to require,<BR>such as by intimate data communication or 
control flow between those<BR>subprograms and other parts of the 
work.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The 
Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<BR>can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<BR>Source.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The 
Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<BR>same 
work.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 2. Basic 
Permissions.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; All rights 
granted under this License are granted for the term of<BR>copyright on the 
Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<BR>conditions are met.&nbsp; 
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<BR>permission to run the 
unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<BR>covered work is covered 
by this License only if the output, given its<BR>content, constitutes a covered 
work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<BR>rights of fair use or other 
equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may make, 
run and propagate covered works that you do not<BR>convey, without conditions so 
long as your license otherwise remains<BR>in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered 
works to others for the sole purpose<BR>of having them make modifications 
exclusively for you, or provide you<BR>with facilities for running those works, 
provided that you comply with<BR>the terms of this License in conveying all 
material for which you do<BR>not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or 
running the covered works<BR>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, 
under your direction<BR>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any 
copies of<BR>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with 
you.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Conveying under 
any other circumstances is permitted solely under<BR>the conditions stated 
below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<BR>makes it 
unnecessary.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 3. Protecting 
Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; No covered work 
shall be deemed part of an effective technological<BR>measure under any 
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<BR>11 of the WIPO copyright 
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<BR>similar laws prohibiting or 
restricting circumvention of such<BR>measures.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; When you convey 
a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<BR>circumvention of 
technological measures to the extent such circumvention<BR>is effected by 
exercising rights under this License with respect to<BR>the covered work, and 
you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<BR>modification of the work as 
a means of enforcing, against the work's<BR>users, your or third parties' legal 
rights to forbid circumvention of<BR>technological measures.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 4. Conveying 
Verbatim Copies.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may convey 
verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<BR>receive it, in any 
medium, provided that you conspicuously and<BR>appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice;<BR>keep intact all notices stating that 
this License and any<BR>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 
apply to the code;<BR>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; 
and give all<BR>recipients a copy of this License along with the 
Program.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may charge 
any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<BR>and you may offer 
support or warranty protection for a fee.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 5. Conveying 
Modified Source Versions.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may convey 
a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<BR>produce it from the 
Program, in the form of source code under the<BR>terms of section 4, provided 
that you also meet all of these conditions:</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 
The work must carry prominent notices stating that you 
modified<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 
The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
released under this License and any conditions added under 
section<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement 
in section 4 to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 
You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; 
This<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any 
applicable section 7<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the 
work, and all its parts,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are 
packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to 
license the work in any other way, but it does not<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) 
If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must 
display<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program 
has interactive<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate 
Legal Notices, your<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do 
so.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A compilation 
of a covered work with other separate and independent<BR>works, which are not by 
their nature extensions of the covered work,<BR>and which are not combined with 
it such as to form a larger program,<BR>in or on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium, is called an<BR>"aggregate" if the compilation and its 
resulting copyright are not<BR>used to limit the access or legal rights of the 
compilation's users<BR>beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion 
of a covered work<BR>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the 
other<BR>parts of the aggregate.</FONT>             </i></P>

Non-Source Forms.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may convey 
a covered work in object code form under the terms<BR>of sections 4 and 5, 
provided that you also convey the<BR>machine-readable Corresponding Source under 
the terms of this License,<BR>in one of these ways:</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical

physical medium<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software 
interchange.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical 
product<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), 
accompanied by a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three 
years and valid for as<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or 
customer support for that product<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone 
who possesses the object code either (1) a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the 
Corresponding Source for all the software in the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product 
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price 
no<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing 
this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy 
the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no 
charge.</FONT>             </i></P>
<P align=left> 
 <i><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 
Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of

Source.&nbsp; This<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only 
occasionally and noncommercially, and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received

equivalent access to the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same 
way through the same place at no<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You 
need not require recipients to copy the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding 
Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding 
Source<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a 
third party)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, 
provided you maintain<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object 
code saying where to find the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; 
Regardless of what server hosts the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, 
you remain obligated to ensure that it is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as

product,<BR>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a 
particular<BR>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to 
a<BR>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the

the recipient in perpetuity or for a<BR>fixed term (regardless of how the 
transaction is characterized), the<BR>Corresponding Source conveyed under this 
section must be accompanied<BR>by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this 
requirement does not apply<BR>if neither you nor any third party retains the 
ability to install<BR>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the 
work has<BR>been installed in ROM).</FONT>             </i></P>

infringed by some manner, permitted<BR>by this License, of making, using, or 
selling its contributor version,<BR>but do not include claims that would be

or other readily accessible means,<BR>then you must either (1) cause the 
Corresponding Source to be so<BR>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself 
of the benefit of the<BR>patent license for this particular work, or (3) 
arrange, in a manner<BR>consistent with the requirements of this License, to 
extend the patent<BR>license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" 
means you have<BR>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your 
conveying the<BR>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the 
covered work<BR>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in 
that<BR>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</FONT>             </i></P>

one or more of the rights that are<BR>specifically granted under this 
License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<BR>work if you are a party to an 
arrangement with a third party that is<BR>in the business of distributing 
software, under which you make payment<BR>to the third party based on the extent 
of your activity of conveying<BR>the work, and under which the third party 
grants, to any of the<BR>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a 
discriminatory<BR>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered 
work<BR>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) 
primarily<BR>for and in connection with specific products or compilations 
that<BR>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that

to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<BR>not convey it at 
all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<BR>to collect a 
royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<BR>the Program, the
