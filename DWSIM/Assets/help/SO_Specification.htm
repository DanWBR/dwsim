<p>The Specification Logical Operation is used to make a variable assume a value
which is a function of another variable, from another object. In opposition to the Adjust Op, 
the Specis calculated automatically if the source variable is modified during the flowsheet 
calculation. In order for the calculator do not make any repeated calculation in the target 
object, one can define the "Calculate target object?" as False.
<br><br>
In the Specification Control panel, the user can define the relation between the variables by
writing a function as complex as necessary. The user can click on the "Evaluate
Expression" to check if the expression is valid.<br>
