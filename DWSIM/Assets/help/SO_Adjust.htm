<p>The Adjust is a logical operation which changes the value of a variable in a stream
in order to attain a specification which can be a user-defined value or the value of other variable,
in other stream. The adjust operation is very useful when there is a specification which cannot be 
accomplished directly, imposing the necessity of doing a trial and error calculation. If this is
the case, the Adjust does everything automatically. This opertion can be compared to a PID controler.

<h3>Settings</h3>
The user selects the controlled (specified) variable and the manipulated one. <br><br>
Then he defines the parameters:<br>

<b>Minimum/Maximum value (optional):</b><br>
There may be a minimum and maximum vale defined to limit the range of allowed values 
for the manipulatd variable.<br><br>

<b>Use as Reference Object:</b><br>

</td>

</tbody></table>


<h3>Parameters</h3>
There are several parameters to define the searching procedure of the Adjust Solver.<br>

<b>Adjust Property Value (or offset):</b><br>
Desired value for the variable or the value to be added or subtracted
from the referenced variable.<br><br>

<b>Maximum Iterations:</b><br>
Maximum number of iterations to be executed by the Adjust Solver. <br><br>

<b>Control Panel:</b> Here the user controls the operation convergence. Two
convergence methods are available, "Secant" and "Brent".&nbsp;
