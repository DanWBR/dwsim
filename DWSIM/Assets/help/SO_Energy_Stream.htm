<p>The energy stream is used to represent energy entering and leaving the limits of the simulation,
used by the unit operations, either to represent loss, demand or power generation. As we are
dealing with steady-state simulations, one defines the energy stream in terms of power (energy
by unit of time) and not energy itself.</p>

The energy either is written by user to be used for energy consuming unit operations or or from 
its connected unit operation as a result of its calculations. <br><br>
