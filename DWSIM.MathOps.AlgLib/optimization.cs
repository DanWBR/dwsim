    /*************************************************************************
    This structure is used to store  OptGuard  report,  i.e.  report  on   the
    properties of the nonlinear function being optimized with ALGLIB.

    After you tell your optimizer to activate OptGuard  this technology starts
    to silently monitor function values and gradients/Jacobians  being  passed
    all around during your optimization session. Depending on specific set  of
    checks enabled OptGuard may perform additional function evaluations  (say,
    about 3*N evaluations if you want to check analytic gradient for errors).

    Upon discovering that something strange happens  (function  values  and/or
    gradient components change too sharply and/or unexpectedly) OptGuard  sets
    one of the "suspicion  flags" (without interrupting optimization session).
    After optimization is done, you can examine OptGuard report.

    Following report fields can be set:
    * nonc0suspected
    * nonc1suspected
    * badgradsuspected


    === WHAT CAN BE DETECTED WITH OptGuard INTEGRITY CHECKER =================

    Following  types  of  errors  in your target function (constraints) can be
    caught:
    a) discontinuous functions ("non-C0" part of the report)
    b) functions with discontinuous derivative ("non-C1" part of the report)
    c) errors in the analytic gradient provided by user

    These types of errors result in optimizer  stopping  well  before reaching
    solution (most often - right after encountering discontinuity).

    Type A errors are usually  coding  errors  during  implementation  of  the
    target function. Most "normal" problems involve continuous functions,  and
    anyway you can't reliably optimize discontinuous function.

    Type B errors are either coding errors or (in case code itself is correct)
    evidence of the fact  that  your  problem  is  an  "incorrect"  one.  Most
    optimizers (except for ones provided by MINNS subpackage) do  not  support
    nonsmooth problems.

    Type C errors are coding errors which often prevent optimizer from  making
    even one step  or result in optimizing stopping  too  early,  as  soon  as
    actual descent direction becomes too different from one suggested by user-
    supplied gradient.


    === WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

    Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous  target functions,
    ones not belonging to C0 continuity class:

    * nonc0suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some indication
      of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the rest of "non-C0" fields
      should be ignored
    * nonc0fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function,  1  or
      higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C0"
    * nonc0lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function which was  suspected
      of being non-continuous.
    * nonc0test0positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
      continuity violation (test #0)

    Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous gradient/Jacobian,
    i.e. with functions violating C1 continuity:

    * nonc1suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some indication
      of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the rest of "non-C1" fields
      should be ignored
    * nonc1fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function,  1  or
      higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
    * nonc1lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function gradient  which  was
      suspected of being non-smooth.
    * nonc1test0positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
      continuity violation (test #0)
    * nonc1test1positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
      continuity violation (test #1)

    Following set of report fields deals with errors in the gradient:
    * badgradsuspected - is a flad which is set upon discovering an  error  in
      the analytic gradient supplied by user
    * badgradfidx - index  of   the  function  with bad gradient (0 for target
      function, 1 or higher for nonlinear constraints)
    * badgradvidx - index of the variable
    * badgradxbase - location where Jacobian is tested
    * following  matrices  store  user-supplied  Jacobian  and  its  numerical
      differentiation version (which is assumed to be  free  from  the  coding
      errors), both of them computed near the initial point:
      * badgraduser, an array[K,N], analytic Jacobian supplied by user
      * badgradnum,  an array[K,N], numeric  Jacobian computed by ALGLIB
      Here K is a total number of  nonlinear  functions  (target  +  nonlinear
      constraints), N is a variable number.
      The  element  of  badgraduser[] with index [badgradfidx,badgradvidx]  is
      assumed to be wrong.

    More detailed error log can  be  obtained  from  optimizer  by  explicitly
    requesting reports for tests C0.0, C1.0, C1.1.

    /*************************************************************************
    This  structure  is  used  for  detailed   reporting  about  suspected  C1
    continuity violation as flagged by C1 test #0 (OptGuard  has several tests
    for C1 continuity, this report is used by #0).

    === WHAT IS TESTED =======================================================

    C1 test #0 studies function values (not gradient!)  obtained  during  line
    searches and monitors behavior of directional  derivative  estimate.  This
    test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  gradient
    values  and  thus  it  is  more  robust  against  artifacts  introduced by
    numerical differentiation.


    === WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

    Actually, report retrieval function returns TWO report structures:

    * one for most suspicious point found so far (one with highest  change  in
      the directional derivative), so called "strongest" report
    * another one for most detailed line search (more function  evaluations  =
      easier to understand what's going on) which triggered  test #0 criteria,
      so called "longest" report

    In both cases following fields are returned:

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
      for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
      values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
    * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
      between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
      with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and
      stpidxa+2.

    You can plot function values stored in stp[]  and  f[]  arrays  and  study
    behavior of your function by your own eyes, just  to  be  sure  that  test
    correctly reported C1 violation.

    This  structure  is  used  for  detailed   reporting  about  suspected  C1
    continuity violation as flagged by C1 test #1 (OptGuard  has several tests
    for C1 continuity, this report is used by #1).

    === WHAT IS TESTED =======================================================

    C1 test #1 studies individual  components  of  the  gradient  as  recorded
    during line searches. Upon discovering discontinuity in the gradient  this
    test records specific component which was suspected (or  one  with  highest
    indication of discontinuity if multiple components are suspected).

    When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
    test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
    gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
    differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
    of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

    This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
    continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
    continuity is violated.


    === WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

    Actually, report retrieval function returns TWO report structures:

    * one for most suspicious point found so far (one with highest  change  in
      the directional derivative), so called "strongest" report
    * another one for most detailed line search (more function  evaluations  =
      easier to understand what's going on) which triggered  test #1 criteria,
      so called "longest" report

    In both cases following fields are returned:

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
      for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
    * vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
      values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
      vidx-th component of the gradient.
    * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
      between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
      with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and
      stpidxa+2.

    You can plot function values stored in stp[]  and  g[]  arrays  and  study

            LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

    DESCRIPTION:
    The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
    Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
    of memory.
    The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
    using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
    It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
    value of order 2*N*M.


    REQUIREMENTS:
    Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
    * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
       and other functions
    3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
    4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem
       with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension. N>0
        M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                    approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                    value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                    considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                    performance. M<=N.
        X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state


    NOTES:
    1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
    2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
       optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
       use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
       L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinLBFGSCreate().  It  uses
    finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

    Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
    only. We recommend to read comments on MinLBFGSCreate() in  order  to  get
    more information about creation of LBFGS optimizer.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                    approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                    value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                    considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                    performance. M<=N.
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
       Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
       nonlinear problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  LBFGS  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinLBFGSSetPrec...()
    functions.

    There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
    same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
    forms of tuning solver.

       (either MinLBFGSCreate() for analytical gradient  or  MinLBFGSCreateF()
       for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
       MinLBFGSOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
       which accepts function ONLY.

       Be careful to choose variant of MinLBFGSOptimize() which corresponds to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed to MinLBFGSOptimize()  and specific

    /*************************************************************************
    This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
    analytic gradient.

    Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
    numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
    (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
    compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

    If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
    continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
    which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
    suspicious by the OptGuard.

    The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlbfgsoptguardresults().

    IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
               about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
               cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

               YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
               CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

    NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
          does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
        TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                        * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                        * TestStep>0 activates verification
                        You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                        too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                        cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                        short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                        numerical derivative.

                        You may use different step for different parameters by
                        means of setting scale with minlbfgssetscale().

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
      * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
        where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
        of i-th parameter
      * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
      * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
      * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
        points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
        point

    This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
    the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
    solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
    a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
    b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

    Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
    that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
    OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

    Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
    than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
    scale problems.

    NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
          continuity violations.

          First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
          the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
          of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

          Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
          noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
          near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
          lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
          discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
          to numerical noise alone.

          Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
          minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
          spotted with restart from different initial point).

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state
        level   -   monitoring level:
                    * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                    * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                          and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                          try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                          get more information about suspicious locations.

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
    the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
    Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
    nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

    Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
    lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
    coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
    stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

    OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
    function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
    errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
    flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
    you can study OptGuard result.

    Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
    session is over.

    === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

    OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
    in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
    * incorrect analytic gradient
    * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
    * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

    Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
    * minlbfgsoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
    * minlbfgsoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

    Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
    * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
      * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
      * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
        single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
        complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
      * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
        differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
        report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
        or MinLM)
    * rep.nonc0suspected
    * rep.nonc1suspected

    === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

    Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
    out specific test signaled error by looking to:
    * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

    Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
    means of:
    * minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test0results()
    * minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test1results()
    which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
    were found, and so on.

    ==========================================================================

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                    retrieved with other functions.

    NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
          ones) are possible although unlikely.

          The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
          nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
          function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
          optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
          wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
          It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
          termination too quickly.

          Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
          our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
          points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

    Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

    Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
    gradient computed during line search.

    When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
    test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
    gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
    differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
    of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

    This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
    continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
    continuity is violated.

    Two reports are returned:
    * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function

                         BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
           WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

    DESCRIPTION:
    The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
    combination of:
    * bound constraints
    * linear inequality constraints
    * linear equality constraints

    REQUIREMENTS:
    * user must provide function value and gradient
    * starting point X0 must be feasible or
      not too far away from the feasible set
    * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
      L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
    * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

    USAGE:

    Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
    Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
    you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
    on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

    2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
       MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

    3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBLEICSetCond().

    4. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

    5. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

    6. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
       with same N but another starting point.
       MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.

    NOTE: if you have box-only constraints (no  general  linear  constraints),
          then MinBC optimizer can be better option. It uses  special,  faster
          constraint activation method, which performs better on problems with
          multiple constraints active at the solution.

          On small-scale problems performance of MinBC is similar to  that  of
          MinBLEIC, but on large-scale ones (hundreds and thousands of  active
          constraints) it can be several times faster than MinBLEIC.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
        X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                    * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                    * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                      to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                      approximation.

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure stores algorithm state

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses

    Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
    only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
    more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
       gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
       problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    * function is evaluated only INSIDE area specified by  bound  constraints,

    This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
    functions.

    There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
    same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
    forms of tuning solver.

       Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object

       which accepts function ONLY.

       Be careful to choose variant of MinBLEICOptimize() which corresponds to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed to MinBLEICOptimize()  and specific
       function used to create optimizer.

       function  and  MinBLEICOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
       combination (for  example,  to  create optimizer with MinBLEICCreateF()
       and  to  pass  gradient information to MinBLEICOptimize()) will lead to
       exception being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS
       needed or you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

    This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied

    Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
    numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
    (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
    compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

    If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
    continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
    which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
    suspicious by the OptGuard.

    The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minbleicoptguardresults().

    IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
               about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
               cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

               YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
               CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

    NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
          does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
        TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                        * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                        * TestStep>0 activates verification
                        You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                        too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                        cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                        short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                        numerical derivative.

                        You may use different step for different parameters by
                        means of setting scale with minbleicsetscale().

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
      * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
        where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
        of i-th parameter
      * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
      * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
      * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
        points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle

    This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
    the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
    solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
    a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
    b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

    Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
    that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
    OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

    Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
    than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
    scale problems.

    NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
          continuity violations.

          First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
          the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
          of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

          Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
          noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
          near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
          lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
          discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
          to numerical noise alone.

          Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
          minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
          spotted with restart from different initial point).

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state
        level   -   monitoring level:
                    * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                    * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                          and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                          try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                          get more information about suspicious locations.

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
    the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
    Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
    nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

    Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
    lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
    coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
    stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

    OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
    function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
    errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
    flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
    you can study OptGuard result.

    Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
    session is over.

    === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

    OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
    in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
    * incorrect analytic gradient
    * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
    * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

    Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
    * minbleicoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
    * minbleicoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

    Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
    * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
      * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
      * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
        single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
        complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
      * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
        differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
        report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
        or MinLM)
    * rep.nonc0suspected
    * rep.nonc1suspected

    === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

    Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
    out specific test signaled error by looking to:
    * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

    Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
    means of:
    * minbleicoptguardnonc1test0results()
    * minbleicoptguardnonc1test1results()
    which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
    were found, and so on.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                    retrieved with other functions.

    NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
          ones) are possible although unlikely.

          The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
          nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
          function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
          optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
          wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
          It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
          termination too quickly.

          Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
          our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
          points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

    derivative estimate.

    This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the

    numerical differentiation.

    Two reports are returned:
    * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function

    In both cases following fields are returned:

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function

    Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

    Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
    gradient computed during line search.

    When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
    test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
    gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
    differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
    of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

    This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
    continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
    continuity is violated.

    Two reports are returned:
    * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
      evaluations, and thus is more detailed

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
      values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
      vidx-th component of the gradient.

    This function tells solver to use BLEIC-based algorithm and sets  stopping

    This algorithm is fast  enough  for large-scale  problems  with  following
    properties:
    a) feasible initial point, moderate amount of general linear constraints
    b) arbitrary (can be infeasible) initial point, small  amount  of  general
       linear constraints (say, hundred or less)

    If you solve large-scale QP problem with many inequality  constraints  and
    without initial feasibility guarantees, consider  using  DENSE-AUL  solver
    instead. Initial feasibility detection stage by BLEIC may take too long on
    such problems.

    ALGORITHM FEATURES:

    * supports dense and sparse QP problems
    * supports box and general linear equality/inequality constraints
    * can solve all types of problems  (convex,  semidefinite,  nonconvex)  as
      long as they are bounded from below under constraints.
      Say, it is possible to solve "min{-x^2} subject to -1<=x<=+1".
      Of course, global  minimum  is found only  for  positive  definite   and
      semidefinite  problems.  As  for indefinite ones - only local minimum is
      found.

    ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

    * BLEIC-QP solver is just a driver function for MinBLEIC solver; it solves
      quadratic  programming   problem   as   general   linearly   constrained
      optimization problem, which is solved by means of BLEIC solver  (part of
      ALGLIB, active set method).

    ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:
    * This algorithm is inefficient on  problems with hundreds  and  thousands
      of general inequality constraints and infeasible initial point.  Initial
      feasibility detection stage may take too long on such constraint sets.
      Consider using DENSE-AUL instead.
    * unlike QuickQP solver, this algorithm does not perform Newton steps  and
      does not use Level 3 BLAS. Being general-purpose active set  method,  it
      can activate constraints only one-by-one. Thus, its performance is lower
      than that of QuickQP.
    * its precision is also a bit  inferior  to  that  of   QuickQP.  BLEIC-QP
      performs only LBFGS steps (no Newton steps), which are good at detecting
      neighborhood of the solution, buy needs many iterations to find solution
      with more than 6 digits of precision.

                    iterations,  which  are  relatively  cheap,  but   improve
                    function value only a bit. So you will need many iterations
                    to converge - from 0.1*N to 10*N, depending  on  problem's
                    condition number.

    IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL MinQPSetScale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
    BECAUSE ITS STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

    Passing EpsG=0, EpsF=0 and EpsX=0 and MaxIts=0 (simultaneously) will lead
    to automatic stopping criterion selection (presently it is  small    step
    length, but it may change in the future versions of ALGLIB).

    ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

    * this  algorithm   is   an   augmented   Lagrangian   method  with  dense
      preconditioner (hence  its  name).  It  is  similar  to  barrier/penalty
      methods, but much more precise and faster.
    * it performs several outer iterations in order to refine  values  of  the
      Lagrange multipliers. Single outer  iteration  is  a  solution  of  some
      unconstrained optimization problem: first  it  performs  dense  Cholesky
      factorization of the Hessian in order to build preconditioner  (adaptive
      regularization is applied to enforce positive  definiteness),  and  then
      it uses L-BFGS optimizer to solve optimization problem.
    * typically you need about 5-10 outer iterations to converge to solution

    ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:

    * because dense Cholesky driver is used, this algorithm has O(N^2)  memory
      requirements and O(OuterIterations*N^3) minimum running time.  From  the
      practical  point  of  view,  it  limits  its  applicability  by  several
      thousands of variables.
      From  the  other  side,  variables  count  is  the most limiting factor,
      and dependence on constraint count is  much  more  lower. Assuming  that
      constraint matrix is sparse, it may handle tens of thousands  of general
      linear constraints.

                      to be sure).
                    * ItsCnt=0 means that small number of outer iterations  is
                      automatically chosen (10 iterations in current version).
                    * ItsCnt=1 means that AUL algorithm performs just as usual

    * supports ONLY box constraints; general linear constraints are NOT
      supported by this solver
    * can solve all types of problems  (convex,  semidefinite,  nonconvex)  as
      long as they are bounded from below under constraints.
      Say, it is possible to solve "min{-x^2} subject to -1<=x<=+1".
      In convex/semidefinite case global minimum  is  returned,  in  nonconvex
      case - algorithm returns one of the local minimums.

    ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

    * algorithm  performs  two kinds of iterations: constrained CG  iterations
      and constrained Newton iterations
    * initially it performs small number of constrained CG  iterations,  which
      can efficiently activate/deactivate multiple constraints
    * after CG phase algorithm tries to calculate Cholesky  decomposition  and
      to perform several constrained Newton steps. If  Cholesky  decomposition
      failed (matrix is indefinite even under constraints),  we  perform  more
      CG iterations until we converge to such set of constraints  that  system
      matrix becomes  positive  definite.  Constrained  Newton  steps  greatly
      increase convergence speed and precision.
    * algorithm interleaves CG and Newton iterations which  allows  to  handle
      indefinite matrices (CG phase) and quickly converge after final  set  of
      constraints is found (Newton phase). Combination of CG and Newton phases
      is called "outer iteration".
    * it is possible to turn off Newton  phase  (beneficial  for  semidefinite
      problems - Cholesky decomposition will fail too often)

    ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:

    * algorithm does not support general  linear  constraints;  only  box ones
      are supported
    * Cholesky decomposition for sparse problems  is  performed  with  Skyline
      Cholesky solver, which is intended for low-profile matrices. No profile-
      reducing reordering of variables is performed in this version of ALGLIB.
    * problems with near-zero negative eigenvalues (or exacty zero  ones)  may
      experience about 2-3x performance penalty. The reason is  that  Cholesky
      decomposition can not be performed until we identify directions of  zero
      and negative curvature and activate corresponding boundary constraints -
      but we need a lot of trial and errors because these directions  are hard
      to notice in the matrix spectrum.
      In this case you may turn off Newton phase of algorithm.
      Large negative eigenvalues  are  not  an  issue,  so  highly  non-convex
      problems can be solved very efficiently.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
        EpsG    -   >=0
                    The  subroutine  finishes  its  work   if   the  condition
                    |v|<EpsG is satisfied, where:
                    * |.| means Euclidian norm
                    * v - scaled constrained gradient vector, v[i]=g[i]*s[i]
                    * g - gradient
                    * s - scaling coefficients set by MinQPSetScale()
        EpsF    -   >=0
                    The  subroutine  finishes its work if exploratory steepest
                    descent  step  on  k+1-th iteration  satisfies   following
                    condition:  |F(k+1)-F(k)|<=EpsF*max{|F(k)|,|F(k+1)|,1}
        EpsX    -   >=0
                    The  subroutine  finishes its work if exploratory steepest
                    descent  step  on  k+1-th iteration  satisfies   following
                    condition:
                    * |.| means Euclidian norm
                    * v - scaled step vector, v[i]=dx[i]/s[i]
                    * dx - step vector, dx=X(k+1)-X(k)
                    * s - scaling coefficients set by MinQPSetScale()
        MaxOuterIts-maximum number of OUTER iterations.  One  outer  iteration
                    includes some amount of CG iterations (from 5 to  ~N)  and
                    one or several (usually small amount) Newton steps.  Thus,
                    one outer iteration has high cost, but can greatly  reduce
                    funcation value.
                    Use 0 if you do not want to limit number of outer iterations.
        UseNewton-  use Newton phase or not:
                    * Newton phase improves performance of  positive  definite
                      dense problems (about 2 times improvement can be observed)
                    * can result in some performance penalty  on  semidefinite
                      or slightly negative definite  problems  -  each  Newton
                      phase will bring no improvement (Cholesky failure),  but
                      still will require computational time.
                    * if you doubt, you can turn off this  phase  -  optimizer
                      will retain its most of its high speed.

    IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL MinQPSetScale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
    BECAUSE ITS STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

    Passing EpsG=0, EpsF=0 and EpsX=0 and MaxIts=0 (simultaneously) will lead
    to automatic stopping criterion selection (presently it is  small    step
    length, but it may change in the future versions of ALGLIB).

    However, it is better to set explicitly solver and its stopping criteria.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   algorithm state

    You should use MinQPResults() function to access results after calls
    to this function.

                                LINEAR PROGRAMMING

    The subroutine creates LP  solver.  After  initial  creation  it  contains
    default optimization problem with zero cost vector and all variables being
    fixed to zero values and no constraints.

    In order to actually solve something you should:
    * set cost vector with minlpsetcost()
    * set variable bounds with minlpsetbc() or minlpsetbcall()
    * specify constraint matrix with one of the following functions:
      [*] minlpsetlc()        for dense one-sided constraints
      [*] minlpsetlc2dense()  for dense two-sided constraints
      [*] minlpsetlc2()       for sparse two-sided constraints
      [*] minlpaddlc2dense()  to add one dense row to constraint matrix
      [*] minlpaddlc2()       to add one row to constraint matrix (compressed format)
    * call minlpoptimize() to run the solver and  minlpresults()  to  get  the
      solution vector and additional information.

    Presently  this  optimizer  supports  only  revised  simplex   method   as
    underlying solver. DSE pricing and bounds flipping ratio  test  (aka  long
    dual step) are supported. Large-scale sparse LU solver with  Forest-Tomlin
    is used internally as linear algebra driver.

    Future releases of ALGLIB may introduce other solvers.

               pair of one-sided constraints.

               Use minlpsetlc2dense(), minlpsetlc2(), minlpaddlc2()  (or   its
               sparse version) wherever possible.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure previously allocated with minlpcreate() call.
        A       -   linear constraints, array[K,N+1]. Each row of A represents
                    one constraint, with first N elements being linear coefficients,
                    and last element being right side.
        CT      -   constraint types, array[K]:
                    * if CT[i]>0, then I-th constraint is A[i,*]*x >= A[i,n]
                    * if CT[i]=0, then I-th constraint is A[i,*]*x  = A[i,n]
                    * if CT[i]<0, then I-th constraint is A[i,*]*x <= A[i,n]
        K       -   number of equality/inequality constraints,  K>=0;  if  not
                    given, inferred from sizes of A and CT.

                      NONLINEARLY  CONSTRAINED  OPTIMIZATION
                WITH PRECONDITIONED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN ALGORITHM

    DESCRIPTION:
    The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
    combination of:
    * bound constraints
    * linear inequality constraints
    * linear equality constraints
    * nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
    * nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)<=0

    REQUIREMENTS:
    * user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()
    * starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
      set
    * F(), G(), H() are twice continuously differentiable on the feasible  set
      and its neighborhood
    * nonlinear constraints G() and H() must have non-zero gradient at  G(x)=0
      and at H(x)=0. Say, constraint like x^2>=1 is supported, but x^2>=0   is
      NOT supported.

    USAGE:

    Constrained optimization if far more complex than the  unconstrained  one.
    Nonlinearly constrained optimization is one of the most esoteric numerical
    procedures.

    Here we give very brief outline  of  the  MinNLC  optimizer.  We  strongly
    recommend you to study examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read
    ALGLIB User Guide on optimization, which is available at
    http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNLCCreate() call  and  chooses
       what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
       with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
       may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
       guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
       default settings.

       From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
       sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.

       In the current release following solvers can be used:
       * SLP solver (activated with minnlcsetalgoslp() function) -  successive
         linear programming, recommended as the first step.
       * AUL solver (activated with minnlcsetalgoaul() function)  -  augmented
         Lagrangian method with dense preconditioner.

       SLP solver is the most robust one  in  ALGLIB  and  converges  in  less
       iterations than AUL; however, each iteration has higher overhead  -  we
       have to solve an LP problem. From  the  other  side,  AUL  has  cheaper
       iterations - although it typically needs more of them, and also  it  is
       less robust in nonconvex setting.

    2. [optional] user activates OptGuard  integrity checker  which  tries  to
       detect possible errors in the user-supplied callbacks:
       * discontinuity/nonsmoothness of the target/nonlinear constraints
       * errors in the analytic gradient provided by user
       This feature is essential for early prototyping stages because it helps
       to catch common coding and problem statement errors.
       OptGuard can be activated with following functions (one per each  check
       performed):
       * minnlcoptguardsmoothness()
       * minnlcoptguardgradient()

    3. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
       of calling one of the following functions:
       a) minnlcsetbc() for boundary constraints
       b) minnlcsetlc() for linear constraints
       c) minnlcsetnlc() for nonlinear constraints
       You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.

    4. User sets scale of the variables with minnlcsetscale() function. It  is
       VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
       constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

    5. User sets  stopping  conditions  with  minnlcsetcond(). If  NLC  solver
       uses  inner/outer  iteration  layout,  this  function   sets   stopping
       conditions for INNER iterations.

    6. Finally, user calls minnlcoptimize()  function  which  takes  algorithm
       state and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates
       F/G/H.

    7. User calls  minnlcresults()  to  get  solution;  additionally  you  can
       retrieve OptGuard report with minnlcoptguardresults(), and get detailed
       report about purported errors in the target function with:
       * minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
       * minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()

    8. Optionally user may call minnlcrestartfrom() to solve  another  problem
       with same N but another starting point. minnlcrestartfrom()  allows  to
       reuse already initialized structure.

    This subroutine is a finite  difference variant of MinNLCCreate(). It uses

        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinNLCSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large TRUNCATION  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large NUMERICAL  errors.  1.0E-4  can  be  good
       value to start from.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is  less   robust   and  precise.  Imprecise  gradient  may  slow  down
       convergence, especially on highly nonlinear problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If
          your problem has mixed constraints, you  may explicitly specify some

    NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to   scale   specified   by
            MinNLCSetScale()  function,  so  it can handle problems with badly
            scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).

            However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
            constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling  of  Gi/Hi  may
            ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  "1000*G0(x)=0"
            is NOT same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".

            It  means  that  YOU  are  the  one who is responsible for correct
            scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend you
            to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component  of
            dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit  magnitude  (for  problems
            with unit scale)  or  has  magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i]

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure stores algorithm state
        S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients

    Exact low-rank preconditioner  uses  Woodbury  matrix  identity  to  build

    * preconditioner evaluation is optimized for K<<N. Its cost  is  O(N*K^2),
      so it may become prohibitively slow for K>=N.

    This  function  tells MinNLC unit to use  Augmented  Lagrangian  algorithm

    Method for  Constrained  Minimization  (1999)"  by  D.GOLDFARB,  R.POLYAK,
    K. SCHEINBERG, I.YUZEFOVICH.

    AUL solver can be significantly faster than SLP on easy problems, although
    it is less robust than SLP (the "gold standard" of robust optimization).

    Augmented Lagrangian algorithm works by converting problem  of  minimizing
    F(x) subject to equality/inequality constraints   to unconstrained problem
    of the form

        min[ f(x) +
            + Rho*PENALTY_EQ(x)   + SHIFT_EQ(x,Nu1) +
            + Rho*PENALTY_INEQ(x) + SHIFT_INEQ(x,Nu2) ]

    where:
    * Rho is a fixed penalization coefficient
    * PENALTY_EQ(x) is a penalty term, which is used to APPROXIMATELY  enforce
      equality constraints
    * SHIFT_EQ(x) is a special "shift"  term  which  is  used  to  "fine-tune"
      equality constraints, greatly increasing precision
    * PENALTY_INEQ(x) is a penalty term which is used to approximately enforce
      inequality constraints
    * SHIFT_INEQ(x) is a special "shift"  term  which  is  used to "fine-tune"
      inequality constraints, greatly increasing precision
    * Nu1/Nu2 are vectors of Lagrange coefficients which are fine-tuned during
      outer iterations of algorithm

    This  version  of  AUL  algorithm  uses   preconditioner,  which   greatly
    accelerates convergence. Because this  algorithm  is  similar  to  penalty
    methods,  it  may  perform  steps  into  infeasible  area.  All  kinds  of
    constraints (boundary, linear and nonlinear ones) may   be   violated   in
    intermediate points - and in the solution.  However,  properly  configured
    AUL method is significantly better at handling  constraints  than  barrier
    and/or penalty methods.

    The very basic outline of algorithm is given below:
    1) first outer iteration is performed with "default"  values  of  Lagrange
       multipliers Nu1/Nu2. Solution quality is low (candidate  point  can  be
       too  far  away  from  true  solution; large violation of constraints is
       possible) and is comparable with that of penalty methods.
    2) subsequent outer iterations  refine  Lagrange  multipliers  and improve
       quality of the solution.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
        Rho     -   penalty coefficient, Rho>0:
                    * large enough  that  algorithm  converges  with   desired
                      precision. Minimum value is 10*max(S'*diag(H)*S),  where
                      S is a scale matrix (set by MinNLCSetScale) and H  is  a
                      Hessian of the function being minimized. If you can  not
                      easily estimate Hessian norm,  see  our  recommendations
                      below.
                    * not TOO large to prevent ill-conditioning
                    * for unit-scale problems (variables and Hessian have unit
                      magnitude), Rho=100 or Rho=1000 can be used.
                    * it is important to note that Rho is internally multiplied
                      by scaling matrix, i.e. optimum value of Rho depends  on
                      scale of variables specified  by  MinNLCSetScale().
        ItsCnt  -   number of outer iterations:
                    * ItsCnt=0 means that small number of outer iterations  is
                      automatically chosen (10 iterations in current version).
                    * ItsCnt=1 means that AUL algorithm performs just as usual
                      barrier method.
                    * ItsCnt>1 means that  AUL  algorithm  performs  specified
                      number of outer iterations

    HOW TO CHOOSE PARAMETERS

    Nonlinear optimization is a tricky area and Augmented Lagrangian algorithm
    is sometimes hard to tune. Good values of  Rho  and  ItsCnt  are  problem-
    specific.  In  order  to  help  you   we   prepared   following   set   of
    recommendations:

    * for  unit-scale  problems  (variables  and Hessian have unit magnitude),
      Rho=100 or Rho=1000 can be used.

    * start from  some  small  value of Rho and solve problem  with  just  one
      outer iteration (ItcCnt=1). In this case algorithm behaves like  penalty
      method. Increase Rho in 2x or 10x steps until you  see  that  one  outer
      iteration returns point which is "rough approximation to solution".

      It is very important to have Rho so  large  that  penalty  term  becomes
      constraining i.e. modified function becomes highly convex in constrained
      directions.

      From the other side, too large Rho may prevent you  from  converging  to
      the solution. You can diagnose it by studying number of inner iterations
      performed by algorithm: too few (5-10 on  1000-dimensional  problem)  or
      too many (orders of magnitude more than  dimensionality)  usually  means
      that Rho is too large.

    * with just one outer iteration you  usually  have  low-quality  solution.
      Some constraints can be violated with very  large  margin,  while  other
      ones (which are NOT violated in the true solution) can push final  point
      too far in the inner area of the feasible set.

      For example, if you have constraint x0>=0 and true solution  x0=1,  then
      merely a presence of "x0>=0" will introduce a bias towards larger values
      of x0. Say, algorithm may stop at x0=1.5 instead of 1.0.

    * after you found good Rho, you may increase number of  outer  iterations.
      ItsCnt=10 is a good value. Subsequent outer iteration will refine values
      of  Lagrange  multipliers.  Constraints  which  were  violated  will  be
      enforced, inactive constraints will be dropped (corresponding multipliers
      will be decreased). Ideally, you  should  see  10-1000x  improvement  in
      constraint handling (constraint violation is reduced).

    * if  you  see  that  algorithm  converges  to  vicinity  of solution, but
      additional outer iterations do not refine solution,  it  may  mean  that
      algorithm is unstable - it wanders around true  solution,  but  can  not
      approach it. Sometimes algorithm may be stabilized by increasing Rho one
      more time, making it 5x or 10x larger.

    SCALING OF CONSTRAINTS [IMPORTANT]

    AUL optimizer scales   variables   according   to   scale   specified   by
    MinNLCSetScale() function, so it can handle  problems  with  badly  scaled
    variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).   However,  because  function
    being optimized is a mix  of  original  function and  constraint-dependent
    penalty  functions, it  is   important  to   rescale  both  variables  AND
    constraints.

    Say,  if  you  minimize f(x)=x^2 subject to 1000000*x>=0,  then  you  have
    constraint whose scale is different from that of target  function (another
    example is 0.000001*x>=0). It is also possible to have constraints   whose
    scales  are   misaligned:   1000000*x0>=0, 0.000001*x1<=0.   Inappropriate
    scaling may ruin convergence because minimizing x^2 subject to x>=0 is NOT
    same as minimizing it subject to 1000000*x>=0.

    Because we  know  coefficients  of  boundary/linear  constraints,  we  can
    automatically rescale and normalize them. However,  there  is  no  way  to
    automatically rescale nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and  Hi(x)  -  they  are
    black boxes.

    It means that YOU are the one who is  responsible  for  correct scaling of
    nonlinear constraints  Gi(x)  and  Hi(x).  We  recommend  you  to  rescale
    nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component of dG/dX (or  dH/dx)
    has magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i] (where S  is  a  scale  set by
    MinNLCSetScale() function).

    WHAT IF IT DOES NOT CONVERGE?

    It is possible that AUL algorithm fails to converge to precise  values  of
    Lagrange multipliers. It stops somewhere around true solution, but candidate
    point is still too far from solution, and some constraints  are  violated.
    Such kind of failure is specific for Lagrangian algorithms -  technically,
    they stop at some point, but this point is not constrained solution.

    There are exist several reasons why algorithm may fail to converge:
    a) too loose stopping criteria for inner iteration
    b) degenerate, redundant constraints
    c) target function has unconstrained extremum exactly at the  boundary  of
       some constraint
    d) numerical noise in the target function

    In all these cases algorithm is unstable - each outer iteration results in
    large and almost random step which improves handling of some  constraints,
    but violates other ones (ideally  outer iterations should form a  sequence
    of progressively decreasing steps towards solution).

    First reason possible is  that  too  loose  stopping  criteria  for  inner
    iteration were specified. Augmented Lagrangian algorithm solves a sequence
    of intermediate problems, and requries each of them to be solved with high
    precision. Insufficient precision results in incorrect update of  Lagrange
    multipliers.

    Another reason is that you may have specified degenerate constraints: say,
    some constraint was repeated twice. In most cases AUL algorithm gracefully
    handles such situations, but sometimes it may spend too much time figuring
    out subtle degeneracies in constraint matrix.

    Third reason is tricky and hard to diagnose. Consider situation  when  you
    minimize  f=x^2  subject to constraint x>=0.  Unconstrained   extremum  is
    located  exactly  at  the  boundary  of  constrained  area.  In  this case
    algorithm will tend to oscillate between negative  and  positive  x.  Each
    time it stops at x<0 it "reinforces" constraint x>=0, and each time it  is
    bounced to x>0 it "relaxes" constraint (and is  attracted  to  x<0).

    Such situation  sometimes  happens  in  problems  with  hidden  symetries.
    Algorithm  is  got  caught  in  a  loop with  Lagrange  multipliers  being
    continuously increased/decreased. Luckily, such loop forms after at  least
    three iterations, so this problem can be solved by  DECREASING  number  of
    outer iterations down to 1-2 and increasing  penalty  coefficient  Rho  as
    much as possible.

    Final reason is numerical noise. AUL algorithm is robust against  moderate
    noise (more robust than, say, active set methods),  but  large  noise  may
    destabilize algorithm.

    This   function  tells  MinNLC  optimizer  to  use  SLP (Successive Linear
    Programming) algorithm for  nonlinearly  constrained   optimization.  This
    algorithm  is  a  slight  modification  of  one  described  in  "A  Linear
    programming-based optimization algorithm for solving nonlinear programming
    problems" (2010) by Claus Still and Tapio Westerlund.

    Despite its name ("linear" = "first order method") this algorithm performs
    steps similar to that of conjugate gradients method;  internally  it  uses
    orthogonality/conjugacy requirement for subsequent steps  which  makes  it
    closer to second order methods in terms of convergence speed.

    Convergence is proved for the following case:
    * function and constraints are continuously differentiable (C1 class)
    * extended Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification  (EMFCQ)  holds;
      in the context of this algorithm EMFCQ  means  that  one  can,  for  any
      infeasible  point,  find  a  search  direction  such that the constraint
      infeasibilities are reduced.

    This algorithm has following nice properties:
    * no parameters to tune
    * no convexity requirements for target function or constraints
    * initial point can be infeasible
    * algorithm respects box constraints in all intermediate points  (it  does
      not even evaluate function outside of box constrained area)
    * once linear constraints are enforced, algorithm will not violate them
    * no such guarantees can be provided for nonlinear constraints,  but  once
      nonlinear constraints are enforced, algorithm will try  to  respect them
      as much as possible
    * numerical differentiation does not  violate  box  constraints  (although
      general linear and nonlinear ones can be violated during differentiation)

    However, following drawbacks can be noted:
    * algorithm performance decreased on problems with dense constraints
    * it has higher iteration cost than AUL - we have to solve an  LP  problem
      at each step.

    We recommend this algorithm as a first step; as soon as you make sure that
    it converges, you can try switching to AUL which is sometimes much faster.

    /*************************************************************************
    This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
    analytic gradient/Jacobian.

    Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
    numerical differentiation of your target  function  (constraints)  at  the
    initial point (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the final
    point) and compares numerical gradient/Jacobian with analytic one provided
    by you.

    If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
    continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
    which stores both gradients/Jacobians, and specific components highlighted
    as suspicious by the OptGuard.

    The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minnlcoptguardresults().

    IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
               about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
               cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

               YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
               CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

    NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
          does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
        TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                        * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                        * TestStep>0 activates verification
                        You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                        too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                        cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                        short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                        numerical derivative.

                        You may use different step for different parameters by
                        means of setting scale with minnlcsetscale().

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
      * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
        where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
        of i-th parameter
      * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
      * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
      * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
        points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
        point

    This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
    the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
    solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
    a) discontinuous target function (non-C0) and/or constraints
    b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1) and/or constraints

    Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
    that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
    OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

    Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
    than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
    scale problems.

    NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
          continuity violations.

          First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
          the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
          of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

          Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
          noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
          near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
          lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
          discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
          to numerical noise alone.

          Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
          minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
          spotted with restart from different initial point).

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state
        level   -   monitoring level:
                    * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                    * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                          and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                          try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                          get more information about suspicious locations.

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
    the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
    Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
    nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

    Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
    lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
    coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
    stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

    OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
    function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
    errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
    flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
    you can study OptGuard result.

    Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
    session is over.

    === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

    OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
    in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
    * incorrect analytic gradient
    * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
    * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

    Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
    * minnlcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
    * minnlcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

    Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
    * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
      * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected
      * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient/Jacobian is tested
      * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient/Jacobian
      * rep.badgradnum, reference gradient/Jacobian obtained via numerical
        differentiation
    * rep.nonc0suspected, and additionally:
      * rep.nonc0fidx - an index of specific function violating C0 continuity
    * rep.nonc1suspected, and additionally
      * rep.nonc1fidx - an index of specific function violating C1 continuity
    Here function index 0 means  target function, index 1  or  higher  denotes
    nonlinear constraints.

    === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

    Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
    out specific test signaled error by looking to:
    * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

    Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
    means of:
    * minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
    * minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()
    which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
    were found, and so on.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                    retrieved with other functions.

    NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
          ones) are possible although unlikely.

          The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
          nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
          function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
          optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
          wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
          It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
          termination too quickly.

          Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
          our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
          points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

    derivative estimate.

    This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the

    Two reports are returned:

      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
      evaluations, and thus is more detailed

    In both cases following fields are returned:

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
      for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
      values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
    * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
      between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,

    When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
    test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
    gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
    differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
    of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

    This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
    continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
    continuity is violated.

    Two reports are returned:
    * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
      evaluations, and thus is more detailed

    In both cases following fields are returned:

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
      for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
    * vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
      values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
      vidx-th component of the gradient.
    * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
      between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
      with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and
      stpidxa+2.

    ==========================================================================
    = SHORTLY SPEAKING: build a 2D plot of (stp,f) and look at it -  you  will
    =                   see where C1 continuity is violated.

                         BOX CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
              WITH FAST ACTIVATION OF MULTIPLE BOX CONSTRAINTS

    DESCRIPTION:
    The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x) of N arguments subject  to box
    constraints (with some of box constraints actually being equality ones).

    This optimizer uses algorithm similar to that of MinBLEIC (optimizer  with
    general linear constraints), but presence of box-only  constraints  allows
    us to use faster constraint activation strategies. On large-scale problems,
    with multiple constraints active at the solution, this  optimizer  can  be
    several times faster than BLEIC.

    REQUIREMENTS:
    * user must provide function value and gradient
    * starting point X0 must be feasible or
      not too far away from the feasible set
    * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
      L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
    * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

    USAGE:

    Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
    Here we give very brief outline of the BC optimizer. We strongly recommend
    you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
    on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBCCreate() call

    2. USer adds box constraints by calling MinBCSetBC() function.

    3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBCSetCond().

    4. User calls MinBCOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

    5. User calls MinBCResults() to get solution

    6. Optionally user may call MinBCRestartFrom() to solve another problem
       with same N but another starting point.
       MinBCRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
        X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                    * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                    * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                      to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                      approximation.

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBCCreate().  It  uses

    more information about creation of BC optimizer.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:

        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBCSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
       gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
       problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    * bound constraints are always satisfied exactly
    * function is evaluated only INSIDE area specified by  bound  constraints,
      even  when  numerical  differentiation is used (algorithm adjusts  nodes
      according to boundary constraints)

    This function sets scaling coefficients for BC optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBCSetPrec...()
    functions.

    There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the

    NOTES:

    1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
       (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
       only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain

       Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
       (either  MinBCCreate() for analytical gradient or  MinBCCreateF()
       for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
       MinBCOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
       which accepts function ONLY.

       Be careful to choose variant of MinBCOptimize() which corresponds to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed to MinBCOptimize()  and specific
       function used to create optimizer.

       Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
       function  and  MinBCOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
       combination (for  example,  to  create optimizer with MinBCCreateF()
       and  to  pass  gradient  information  to  MinCGOptimize()) will lead to
       exception being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS
       needed or you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

    /*************************************************************************
    This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
    analytic gradient.

    Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
    numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
    (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
    compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

    If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
    continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
    which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
    suspicious by the OptGuard.

    The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minbcoptguardresults().

    IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
               about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
               cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

               YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
               CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

    NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
          does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
        TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                        * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                        * TestStep>0 activates verification
                        You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                        too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                        cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                        short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                        numerical derivative.

                        You may use different step for different parameters by
                        means of setting scale with minbcsetscale().

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
      * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
        where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
        of i-th parameter
      * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
      * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
      * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
        points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
        point

    This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
    the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
    solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
    a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
    b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

    Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
    that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
    OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

    Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
    than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
    scale problems.

    NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
          continuity violations.

          First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
          the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
          of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

          Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
          noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
          near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
          lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
          discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
          to numerical noise alone.

          Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
          minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
          spotted with restart from different initial point).

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state
        level   -   monitoring level:
                    * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                    * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                          and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                          try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                          get more information about suspicious locations.

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
    the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
    Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
    nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

    Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
    lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
    coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
    stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

    OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
    function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
    errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
    flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
    you can study OptGuard result.

    Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
    session is over.

    === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

    OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
    in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
    * incorrect analytic gradient
    * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
    * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

    Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
    * minbcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
    * minbcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

    Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
    * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
      * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
      * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
        single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
        complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
      * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
        differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
        report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
        or MinLM)
    * rep.nonc0suspected
    * rep.nonc1suspected

    === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

    Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
    out specific test signaled error by looking to:
    * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

    Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
    means of:
    * minbcoptguardnonc1test0results()
    * minbcoptguardnonc1test1results()
    which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
    were found, and so on.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                    retrieved with other functions.

    NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
          ones) are possible although unlikely.

          The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
          nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
          function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
          optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
          wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
          It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
          termination too quickly.

          Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
          our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
          points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

    Nonsmoothness (non-C1) test #0 studies  function  values  (not  gradient!)
    obtained during line searches and monitors  behavior  of  the  directional
    derivative estimate.

    This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
    gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
    numerical differentiation.

    Two reports are returned:
    * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
      evaluations, and thus is more detailed

    In both cases following fields are returned:

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
      values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.

    Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

    Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
    gradient computed during line search.

    When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
    test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
    gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
    differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
    of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

    This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
    continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
    continuity is violated.

    Two reports are returned:
    * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
      evaluations, and thus is more detailed

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
      values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
      vidx-th component of the gradient.
    * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
      between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,

               restrictions of AGS solver.

    REQUIREMENTS:
    * starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
      set
    * F(), G(), H() are continuous, locally Lipschitz  and  continuously  (but
      not necessarily twice) differentiable in an open dense  subset  of  R^N.
      Functions F(), G() and H() may be nonsmooth and non-convex.
      Informally speaking, it means  that  functions  are  composed  of  large
      differentiable "patches" with nonsmoothness having  place  only  at  the
      boundaries between these "patches".
      Most real-life nonsmooth  functions  satisfy  these  requirements.  Say,
      anything which involves finite number of abs(), min() and max() is  very
      likely to pass the test.
      Say, it is possible to optimize anything of the following:
      * f=abs(x0)+2*abs(x1)
      * f=max(x0,x1)
      * f=sin(max(x0,x1)+abs(x2))
    * for nonlinearly constrained problems: F()  must  be  bounded from  below
      without nonlinear constraints (this requirement is due to the fact that,
      contrary to box and linear constraints, nonlinear ones  require  special
      handling).
    * user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()  at  all
      points where function/gradient can be calculated. If optimizer  requires
      value exactly at the boundary between "patches" (say, at x=0 for f=abs(x)),
      where gradient is not defined, user may resolve tie arbitrarily (in  our
      case - return +1 or -1 at its discretion).
    * NS solver supports numerical differentiation, i.e. it may  differentiate
      your function for you,  but  it  results  in  2N  increase  of  function
      evaluations. Not recommended unless you solve really small problems. See
      minnscreatef() for more information on this functionality.

    USAGE:

    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNSCreate() call  and   chooses
       what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
       with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
       may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
       guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
       default settings.

       From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
       sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.

       In the current release following solvers can be used:
       * AGS solver (activated with MinNSSetAlgoAGS() function)

    2. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
       of calling one of the following functions:
       a) MinNSSetBC() for boundary constraints
       b) MinNSSetLC() for linear constraints
       c) MinNSSetNLC() for nonlinear constraints
       You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.

    3. User sets scale of the variables with MinNSSetScale() function. It   is
       VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
       constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

    4. User sets stopping conditions with MinNSSetCond().

    5. Finally, user calls MinNSOptimize()  function  which  takes   algorithm
       state and pointer (delegate, etc) to callback function which calculates
       F/G/H.

    7. User calls MinNSResults() to get solution

    8. Optionally user may call MinNSRestartFrom() to solve   another  problem
       with same N but another starting point. MinNSRestartFrom()  allows   to
       reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                    * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                    * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                      to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                      approximation.

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure stores algorithm state

    NOTE: minnscreatef() function may be used if  you  do  not  have  analytic
          gradient.   This   function  creates  solver  which  uses  numerical
          differentiation with user-specified step.

    NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If
          your problem has mixed constraints, you  may explicitly specify some
          of them as linear ones. It may help optimizer to  handle  them  more
          efficiently.

        NLEC    -   number of Non-Linear Equality Constraints (NLEC), >=0
        NLIC    -   number of Non-Linear Inquality Constraints (NLIC), >=0

    NOTE 1: nonlinear constraints are satisfied only  approximately!   It   is
            possible   that  algorithm  will  evaluate  function  outside   of
            the feasible area!

    NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to   scale   specified   by
            minnssetscale()  function,  so  it can handle problems with  badly
            scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).

            However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
            constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling  of  Gi/Hi  may
            ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  "1000*G0(x)=0"
            is NOT same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".

            It  means  that  YOU  are  the  one who is responsible for correct
            scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend you
            to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component  of
            dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit  magnitude  (for  problems
            with unit scale)  or  has  magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i]
            (where S is a scale set by minnssetscale() function).

    NOTE 3: nonlinear constraints are always hard to handle,  no  matter  what
            algorithm you try to use. Even basic box/linear constraints modify
            function  curvature   by  adding   valleys  and  ridges.  However,
            nonlinear constraints add valleys which are very  hard  to  follow
            due to their "curved" nature.

            It means that optimization with single nonlinear constraint may be
            significantly slower than optimization with multiple linear  ones.
            It is normal situation, and we recommend you to  carefully  choose
            Rho parameter of minnssetalgoags(), because too  large  value  may
            slow down convergence.

    This function tells MinNS unit to use  AGS  (adaptive  gradient  sampling)
    algorithm for nonsmooth constrained  optimization.  This  algorithm  is  a
    slight modification of one described in  "An  Adaptive  Gradient  Sampling
    Algorithm for Nonsmooth Optimization" by Frank E. Curtisy and Xiaocun Quez.

    This optimizer has following benefits and drawbacks:
    + robustness; it can be used with nonsmooth and nonconvex functions.
    + relatively easy tuning; most of the metaparameters are easy to select.
    - it has convergence of steepest descent, slower than CG/LBFGS.
    - each iteration involves evaluation of ~2N gradient values  and  solution
      of 2Nx2N quadratic programming problem, which  limits  applicability  of
      algorithm by small-scale problems (up to 50-100).

    IMPORTANT: this  algorithm  has  convergence  guarantees,   i.e.  it  will
               steadily move towards some stationary point of the function.

               However, "stationary point" does not  always  mean  "solution".
               Nonsmooth problems often have "flat spots",  i.e.  areas  where
               function do not change at all. Such "flat spots" are stationary
               points by definition, and algorithm may be caught here.

               Nonsmooth CONVEX tasks are not prone to  this  problem. Say, if
               your function has form f()=MAX(f0,f1,...), and f_i are  convex,
               then f() is convex too and you have guaranteed  convergence  to
               solution.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
        Radius  -   initial sampling radius, >=0.

                    Internally multiplied  by  vector of  per-variable  scales
                    specified by minnssetscale()).

                    You should select relatively large sampling radius, roughly
                    proportional to scaled length of the first  steps  of  the
                    algorithm. Something close to 0.1 in magnitude  should  be
                    good for most problems.

                    AGS solver can automatically decrease radius, so too large
                    radius is  not a problem (assuming that you  won't  choose
                    so large radius that algorithm  will  sample  function  in
                    too far away points, where gradient value is irrelevant).

                    Too small radius won't cause algorithm to fail, but it may
                    slow down algorithm (it may  have  to  perform  too  short
                    steps).
        Penalty -   penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints:
                    * for problem with nonlinear constraints  should  be  some
                      problem-specific  positive   value,  large  enough  that
                      penalty term changes shape of the function.
                      Starting  from  some  problem-specific   value   penalty
                      coefficient becomes  large  enough  to  exactly  enforce
                      nonlinear constraints;  larger  values  do  not  improve
                      precision.
                      Increasing it too much may slow down convergence, so you
                      should choose it carefully.
                    * can be zero for problems WITHOUT  nonlinear  constraints
                      (i.e. for unconstrained ones or ones with  just  box  or
                      linear constraints)
                    * if you specify zero value for problem with at least  one
                      nonlinear  constraint,  algorithm  will  terminate  with
                      error code -1.

    ALGORITHM OUTLINE

    The very basic outline of unconstrained AGS algorithm is given below:

    0. If sampling radius is below EpsX  or  we  performed  more  then  MaxIts
       iterations - STOP.
    1. sample O(N) gradient values at random locations  around  current point;
       informally speaking, this sample is an implicit piecewise  linear model
       of the function, although algorithm formulation does  not  mention that
       explicitly
    2. solve quadratic programming problem in order to find descent direction
    3. if QP solver tells us that we  are  near  solution,  decrease  sampling
       radius and move to (0)
    4. perform backtracking line search
    5. after moving to new point, goto (0)

    As for the constraints:
    * box constraints are handled exactly  by  modification  of  the  function
      being minimized
    * linear/nonlinear constraints are handled by adding L1  penalty.  Because
      our solver can handle nonsmoothness, we can  use  L1  penalty  function,
      which is an exact one  (i.e.  exact  solution  is  returned  under  such
      penalty).
    * penalty coefficient for  linear  constraints  is  chosen  automatically;
      however, penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints must be specified
      by user.

    NOTES:

    1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
       (analytical) user-supplied Jacobian, and one which uses  only  function
       vector and numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
       gradient.

       Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
       you should choose appropriate variant of  minnsoptimize() -  one  which
       accepts function AND Jacobian or one which accepts ONLY function.

       Be careful to choose variant of minnsoptimize()  which  corresponds  to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed to minnsoptimize()    and  specific
       function used to create optimizer.

       Here "FAILS" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer creation
       function  and  minnsoptimize()  version.   Attemps   to    use     such
       combination will lead to exception. Either  you  did  not pass gradient

            NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

    DESCRIPTION:
    The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
    nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

    These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
    long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
    L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


    REQUIREMENTS:
    Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
    * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
       other functions
    3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
    4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
       with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
    finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

    Description below contains information which is specific to this function
    only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
    information about creation of CG optimizer.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
       Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
       nonlinear problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

    There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
    same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
    forms of tuning solver.

        State   -   structure stores algorithm state
        S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients

    This function allows to suggest initial step length to the CG algorithm.

    Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It
    can be useful when you have  badly  scaled  problem,  i.e.  when  ||grad||
    (which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
    magnitude different from the desired step.

    Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
    step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
    step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,

       numerical differentiation) you should  choose  appropriate  variant  of
       MinCGOptimize() - one which accepts function AND gradient or one  which
       accepts function ONLY.

       Be careful to choose variant of MinCGOptimize()  which  corresponds  to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed  to  MinCGOptimize()  and  specific
       function used to create optimizer.

       function and MinCGOptimize() version. Attemps to use  such  combination
       (for  example,  to create optimizer with  MinCGCreateF()  and  to  pass
       gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to  exception  being
       thrown. Either  you  did  not  pass  gradient when it WAS needed or you

    This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied

    Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
    numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
    (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
    compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

    If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
    continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
    which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
    suspicious by the OptGuard.

    The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with mincgoptguardresults().

    IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
               about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
               cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

               YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
               CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

    NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
          does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

        State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
        TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:

                        You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                        too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                        cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                        short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                        numerical derivative.

                        You may use different step for different parameters by
                        means of setting scale with mincgsetscale().

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
      * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
        where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
        of i-th parameter
      * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
      * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
      * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
        points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle

    This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
    the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
    solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
    a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
    b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

    Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
    that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
    OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

    Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
    than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
    scale problems.

    NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
          continuity violations.

          First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
          the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
          of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

          Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
          noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
          near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
          lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
          discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
          to numerical noise alone.

          Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
          minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
          spotted with restart from different initial point).

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state
        level   -   monitoring level:
                    * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                    * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                          and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                          try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                          get more information about suspicious locations.

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
    the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
    Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
    nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

    Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
    lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
    coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
    stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

    OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
    function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
    errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
    flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
    you can study OptGuard result.

    Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
    session is over.

    === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

    OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
    in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
    * incorrect analytic gradient
    * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
    * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

    Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
    * mincgoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
    * mincgoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

    Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
    * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
      * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
      * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
        single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
        complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
      * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
        differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
        report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
        or MinLM)
    * rep.nonc0suspected
    * rep.nonc1suspected

    === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

    Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
    out specific test signaled error by looking to:
    * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
    * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

    Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
    means of:
    * mincgoptguardnonc1test0results()
    * mincgoptguardnonc1test1results()
    which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
    were found, and so on.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        state   -   algorithm state

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                    retrieved with other functions.

    NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
          ones) are possible although unlikely.

          The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
          nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
          function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
          optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
          wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
          It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
          termination too quickly.

          Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
          our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
          points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

    Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #0

    Nonsmoothness (non-C1) test #0 studies  function  values  (not  gradient!)
    obtained during line searches and monitors  behavior  of  the  directional
    derivative estimate.

    This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
    gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
    numerical differentiation.

    Two reports are returned:
    * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
      evaluations, and thus is more detailed

    In both cases following fields are returned:

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
      values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
    * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
      between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,

    Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

    Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
    gradient computed during line search.

    When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
    test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
    gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
    differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
    of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

    This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
    continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
    continuity is violated.

    Two reports are returned:
    * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
      value of the nonsmoothness indicator
    * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
      evaluations, and thus is more detailed

    * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
      did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
    * vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
    * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
      for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
    * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
      values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
      vidx-th component of the gradient.
    * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
      between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,

    There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
    correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
    unit. You should choose version which accepts fvec()  and jac() callbacks.
    First  one  is used to calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates
    f[] and Jacobian df[i]/dx[j].

    You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ  function and  then
    use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize()  (for  example,  version  which
    works  with  general  form function and does not provide Jacobian), but it
    will  lead  to  exception  being  thrown  after first attempt to calculate
    Jacobian.


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateVJ() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
       other functions
    3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
       callback functions.
    4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
       with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step

    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
    optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
    condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

    Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
    important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is

    IMPORTANT: if you have linear constraints, it is strongly  recommended  to
               set scale of variables with minlmsetscale(). QP solver which is
               used to calculate linearly constrained steps heavily relies  on
               good scaling of input problems.

    IMPORTANT: solvers created with minlmcreatefgh()  do  not  support  linear
               constraints.

    NOTE: linear  (non-bound)  constraints are satisfied only approximately  -
          there  always  exists some violation due  to  numerical  errors  and
          algorithmic limitations.

    NOTE: general linear constraints  add  significant  overhead  to  solution
          process. Although solver performs roughly same amount of  iterations
          (when compared  with  similar  box-only  constrained  problem), each
          iteration   now    involves  solution  of  linearly  constrained  QP
          subproblem, which requires ~3-5 times more Cholesky  decompositions.
          Thus, if you can reformulate your problem in such way  this  it  has
          only box constraints, it may be beneficial to do so.

    This function is used to change acceleration settings

    You can choose between three acceleration strategies:
    * AccType=0, no acceleration.
    * AccType=1, secant updates are used to update quadratic model after  each
      iteration. After fixed number of iterations (or after  model  breakdown)
      we  recalculate  quadratic  model  using  analytic  Jacobian  or  finite
      differences. Number of secant-based iterations depends  on  optimization
      settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
      iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.

    AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost is prohibitively
    high (several Mx1 function vector calculations  followed  by  several  NxN
    Cholesky factorizations are faster than calculation of one M*N  Jacobian).
    It should also be used when we have no Jacobian, because finite difference
    approximation takes too much time to compute.

    Table below list  optimization  protocols  (XYZ  protocol  corresponds  to
    MinLMCreateXYZ) and acceleration types they support (and use by  default).

    ACCELERATION TYPES SUPPORTED BY OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOLS:

    protocol    0   1   comment
    V           +   +
    VJ          +   +
    FGH         +

    DEFAULT VALUES:

    protocol    0   1   comment
    V               x   without acceleration it is so slooooooooow
    VJ          x
    FGH         x

    NOTE: this  function should be called before optimization. Attempt to call
    it during algorithm iterations may result in unexpected behavior.

    NOTE: attempt to call this function with unsupported protocol/acceleration
    combination will result in exception being thrown.

    NOTES:

    1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
       may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
       said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
       different sets of callbacks.

       This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
       MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
       does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
       will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

       Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
       compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

    /*************************************************************************
    This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
    analytic Jacobian.

    Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
    numerical differentiation of your target function vector  at  the  initial
    point (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the final  point)
    and compares numerical Jacobian with analytic one provided by you.

    If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
    continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
    which stores  both  Jacobians,  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
    suspicious by the OptGuard.

    The OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlmoptguardresults().

    IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
               about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
               cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

               YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
               CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

    NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
          does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
        TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                        * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                        * TestStep>0 activates verification
                        You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                        too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                        cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                        short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                        numerical derivative.

                        You may use different step for different parameters by
                        means of setting scale with minlmsetscale().

    === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

    In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
      * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
        where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
        of i-th parameter
      * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
      * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
      * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
        points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
        point

    Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization

    OptGuard checks analytic Jacobian  against  reference  value  obtained  by

    NOTE: other optimizers perform additional OptGuard checks for things  like
          C0/C1-continuity violations. However, LM optimizer  can  check  only
          for incorrect Jacobian.

          The reason is that unlike line search methods LM optimizer does  not

    This check is activated with  minlmoptguardgradient() function.

    Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
    * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
      * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
      * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected

    stops at point which was "current accepted" when termination  request  was

    NOTE: after  request  for  termination  optimizer  may   perform   several

        of the Hessian matrix. It should be used to  accelerate  steepest  descent
        phase of the QP solver.

        Although  it  is  called  "scale-grad",  it  can be called for any vector,
        whether it is gradient, anti-gradient, or just some vector.

        This function does NOT takes into account current set of  constraints,  it
        just performs matrix-vector multiplication  without  taking  into  account
        constraints.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            S       -   model
            X       -   vector to scale

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            X       -   scaled vector
            
        NOTE:
            when called for non-SPD matrices, it silently skips components of X
            which correspond to zero or negative diagonal elements.
            
        NOTE:
            this function uses diagonals of A and D; it ignores Q - rank-K term of
            the quadratic model.

        This subroutine calls CQMRebuild() and evaluates model at X subject to

        It  is  intended  for  debug  purposes only, because it evaluates model by
        means of temporaries, which were calculated  by  CQMRebuild().  The   only
        purpose of this function  is  to  check  correctness  of  CQMRebuild()  by

        NOTE: suffix T denotes that temporaries marked by T-prefix are used. There
              is one more variant of this function, which uses  "effective"  model

        /*************************************************************************
        This structure is used to store  OptGuard  report,  i.e.  report  on   the
        properties of the nonlinear function being optimized with ALGLIB.

        After you tell your optimizer to activate OptGuard  this technology starts
        to silently monitor function values and gradients/Jacobians  being  passed
        all around during your optimization session. Depending on specific set  of
        checks enabled OptGuard may perform additional function evaluations  (say,
        about 3*N evaluations if you want to check analytic gradient for errors).

        Upon discovering that something strange happens  (function  values  and/or
        gradient components change too sharply and/or unexpectedly) OptGuard  sets
        one of the "suspicion  flags" (without interrupting optimization session).
        After optimization is done, you can examine OptGuard report.

        Following report fields can be set:
        * nonc0suspected
        * nonc1suspected
        * badgradsuspected


        === WHAT CAN BE DETECTED WITH OptGuard INTEGRITY CHECKER =================

        Following  types  of  errors  in your target function (constraints) can be
        caught:
        a) discontinuous functions ("non-C0" part of the report)
        b) functions with discontinuous derivative ("non-C1" part of the report)
        c) errors in the analytic gradient provided by user

        These types of errors result in optimizer  stopping  well  before reaching
        solution (most often - right after encountering discontinuity).

        Type A errors are usually  coding  errors  during  implementation  of  the
        target function. Most "normal" problems involve continuous functions,  and
        anyway you can't reliably optimize discontinuous function.

        Type B errors are either coding errors or (in case code itself is correct)
        evidence of the fact  that  your  problem  is  an  "incorrect"  one.  Most
        optimizers (except for ones provided by MINNS subpackage) do  not  support
        nonsmooth problems.

        Type C errors are coding errors which often prevent optimizer from  making
        even one step  or result in optimizing stopping  too  early,  as  soon  as
        actual descent direction becomes too different from one suggested by user-
        supplied gradient.


        === WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

        Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous  target functions,
        ones not belonging to C0 continuity class:

        * nonc0suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some indication
          of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the rest of "non-C0" fields
          should be ignored
        * nonc0fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function,  1  or
          higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C0"
        * nonc0lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function which was  suspected
          of being non-continuous.
        * nonc0test0positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
          continuity violation (test #0)

        Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous gradient/Jacobian,
        i.e. with functions violating C1 continuity:

        * nonc1suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some indication
          of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the rest of "non-C1" fields
          should be ignored
        * nonc1fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function,  1  or
          higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
        * nonc1lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function gradient  which  was
          suspected of being non-smooth.
        * nonc1test0positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
          continuity violation (test #0)
        * nonc1test1positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
          continuity violation (test #1)

        Following set of report fields deals with errors in the gradient:
        * badgradsuspected - is a flad which is set upon discovering an  error  in
          the analytic gradient supplied by user
        * badgradfidx - index  of   the  function  with bad gradient (0 for target
          function, 1 or higher for nonlinear constraints)
        * badgradvidx - index of the variable
        * badgradxbase - location where Jacobian is tested
        * following  matrices  store  user-supplied  Jacobian  and  its  numerical
          differentiation version (which is assumed to be  free  from  the  coding
          errors), both of them computed near the initial point:
          * badgraduser, an array[K,N], analytic Jacobian supplied by user
          * badgradnum,  an array[K,N], numeric  Jacobian computed by ALGLIB
          Here K is a total number of  nonlinear  functions  (target  +  nonlinear
          constraints), N is a variable number.
          The  element  of  badgraduser[] with index [badgradfidx,badgradvidx]  is
          assumed to be wrong.

        More detailed error log can  be  obtained  from  optimizer  by  explicitly
        requesting reports for tests C0.0, C1.0, C1.1.

        This  structure  is  used  for  detailed   reporting  about  suspected  C1
        continuity violation as flagged by C1 test #0 (OptGuard  has several tests
        for C1 continuity, this report is used by #0).

        === WHAT IS TESTED =======================================================

        C1 test #0 studies function values (not gradient!)  obtained  during  line
        searches and monitors behavior of directional  derivative  estimate.  This
        test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  gradient
        values  and  thus  it  is  more  robust  against  artifacts  introduced by
        numerical differentiation.


        === WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

        Actually, report retrieval function returns TWO report structures:

        * one for most suspicious point found so far (one with highest  change  in
          the directional derivative), so called "strongest" report
        * another one for most detailed line search (more function  evaluations  =
          easier to understand what's going on) which triggered  test #0 criteria,
          so called "longest" report

        In both cases following fields are returned:

        * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
          did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
        * fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
          for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
        * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
          for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
        * stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
          values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
        * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
          between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
          with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and
          stpidxa+2.

        You can plot function values stored in stp[]  and  f[]  arrays  and  study
        behavior of your function by your own eyes, just  to  be  sure  that  test
        correctly reported C1 violation.

        for C1 continuity, this report is used by #1).

        === WHAT IS TESTED =======================================================

        C1 test #1 studies individual  components  of  the  gradient  as  recorded
        during line searches. Upon discovering discontinuity in the gradient  this
        test records specific component which was suspected (or  one  with  highest
        indication of discontinuity if multiple components are suspected).

        When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
        test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
        gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
        differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
        of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

        This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
        continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
        continuity is violated.

          for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
        * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
          values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
          vidx-th component of the gradient.

        NOTE: we assume that SrcRep contains scaled X0[], D[] and G[], i.e. explicit
              variable scaling was applied. We need to rescale them during export,
              that's why we need S[] parameter.

        NOTE 2: in fact, projection of ANTI-gradient is calculated,  because  this
        function trims components of -G which points outside of the feasible area.
        However, working with -G is considered confusing, because all optimization
        source work with G.

              responsibility of the caller.
            * steps smaller than MaxStepLen still can activate constraints due  to
              numerical errors. Thus purpose of this  function  is  not  to  guard 
              against accidental activation of the constraints - quite the reverse, 
              its purpose is to activate at least constraint upon performing  step
              which is too long.
            * in case there is no constraints to activate, we return negative
              VariableToFreeze and zero MaxStepLen and ValueToFreeze.
            * this function assumes that constraints are consistent; it throws
              exception otherwise.

        This function postprocesses bounded step by:

        This function calculates inexact rank-K preconditioner for Hessian  matrix
        H=D+W'*C*W, where:
        * H is a Hessian matrix, which is approximated by D/W/C
        * D is a diagonal matrix with positive entries
        * W is a rank-K correction
        * C is a diagonal factor of rank-K correction

        This preconditioner is inexact but fast - it requires O(N*K)  time  to  be
        applied. Its main purpose - to be  used  in  barrier/penalty/AUL  methods,
        where ill-conditioning is created by combination of two factors:
        * simple bounds on variables => ill-conditioned D
        * general barrier/penalty => correction W  with large coefficient C (makes
          problem ill-conditioned) but W itself is well conditioned.

        Preconditioner P is calculated by artificially constructing a set of  BFGS
        updates which tries to reproduce behavior of H:
        * Sk = Wk (k-th row of W)
        * Yk = (D+Wk'*Ck*Wk)*Sk
        * Yk/Sk are reordered by ascending of C[k]*norm(Wk)^2

        Here we assume that rows of Wk are orthogonal or nearly orthogonal,  which
        allows us to have O(N*K+K^2) update instead of O(N*K^2) one. Reordering of
        updates is essential for having good performance on non-orthogonal problems
        (updates which do not add much of curvature are added first,  and  updates
        which add very large eigenvalues are added last and override effect of the
        first updates).

        On input this function takes direction S and components of H.
        On output it returns inv(H)*S

        This function prepares exact low-rank preconditioner  for  Hessian  matrix
        H=D+W'*C*W, where:
        * H is a Hessian matrix, which is approximated by D/W/C
        * D is a diagonal matrix with positive entries
        * W is a rank-K correction
        * C is a diagonal factor of rank-K correction, positive semidefinite

        This preconditioner is exact but relatively slow -  it  requires  O(N*K^2)
        time to be prepared and O(N*K) time to be applied. It is  calculated  with
        the help of Woodbury matrix identity.

        It should be used as follows:
        * PrepareLowRankPreconditioner() call PREPARES data structure
        * subsequent calls to ApplyLowRankPreconditioner() APPLY preconditioner to
          user-specified search direction.

        An interval between F1 and F2 is  tested  for  (dis)continuity.  Per-point

        special correction which helps to detect "max(0,1/x)"-like discontinuities.
        Without this correction algorithm will still work, but will be a bit  less
        powerful. Do not use this correction  for  situations  when  you  want  to
        estimate continuity around some non-extremal point  -  it  may  result  in

        This  subroutine checks C1 continuity using test #1  (individual  gradient
        components from the line search log are studied for continuity).

        An interval between F[StpIdx+0] and F[StpIdx+3]is  tested for  continuity.
        An normalized error metric (Lipschitz constant growth for the  derivative)
        for the interval in question is calculated. Values above  50  are  a  good
        indication of the discontinuity.

        This subroutine is used to initialize SNNLS solver.

        By default, empty NNLS problem is produced, but we allocated enough  space
        to store problems with NSMax+NDMax columns and  NRMax  rows.  It  is  good
        place to provide algorithm with initial estimate of the space requirements,
        although you may underestimate problem size or even pass zero estimates  -
        in this case buffer variables will be resized automatically  when  you set
        NNLS problem.

        Previously allocated buffer variables are reused as much as possible. This
        function does not clear structure completely, it tries to preserve as much
        dynamically allocated memory as possible.

        This structure describes set of linear constraints (boundary  and  general
        ones) which can be active and inactive. It also has functionality to  work
        with current point and current  gradient  (determine  active  constraints,
        move current point, project gradient into  constrained  subspace,  perform
        constrained preconditioning and so on.

        This  structure  is  intended  to  be  used  by constrained optimizers for
        management of all constraint-related functionality.

        External code may access following internal fields of the structure:
            XC          -   stores current point, array[N].
                            can be accessed only in optimization mode

                            * CStatus[I]=0    I-th constraint is at the boundary, but inactive
                            * CStatus[I]<0    I-th constraint is far from the boundary (and inactive)
                            * elements from 0 to N-1 correspond to boundary constraints
                            * elements from N to N+NEC+NIC-1 correspond to linear constraints
                            * elements from N to N+NEC-1 are always +1

                            feasible w.r.t. general linear constraints.
                            This field can be used by unit test to  validate  some
                            details of initial point calculation algorithm.

                            product:
                            a) for "P" batch - one  given  by preconditioner matrix
                               (inverse Hessian)
                            b) for "S" one - one given by square of the scale matrix

        This function sets scaling coefficients for SAS object.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        During orthogonalization phase, scale is used to calculate drop tolerances
        (whether vector is significantly non-zero or not).

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state
            S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients
                        S[i] may be negative, sign doesn't matter.

        This function sets linear constraints for SAS object.

        Linear constraints are inactive by default (after initial creation).

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   SAS structure
            C       -   linear constraints, array[K,N+1].
                        Each row of C represents one constraint, either equality
                        or inequality (see below):
                        * first N elements correspond to coefficients,
                        * last element corresponds to the right part.
                        All elements of C (including right part) must be finite.
            CT      -   type of constraints, array[K]:
                        * if CT[i]>0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x >= C[i,n+1]
                        * if CT[i]=0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x  = C[i,n+1]
                        * if CT[i]<0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x <= C[i,n+1]
            K       -   number of equality/inequality constraints, K>=0

        NOTE 1: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:
        * there always exists some minor violation (about Epsilon in magnitude)
          due to rounding errors
        * numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
          outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
          numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.
        If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
        problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
        (this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
        solution and in all intermediate points).

        This subroutine moves current point to XN, which can be:
        a) point in the direction previously explored  with  SASExploreDirection()
           function (in this case NeedAct/CIdx/CVal are used)
        b) point in arbitrary direction, not necessarily previously  checked  with
           SASExploreDirection() function.

        Step may activate one constraint. It is assumed than XN  is  approximately
        feasible (small error as  large  as several  ulps  is  possible).   Strict
        feasibility  with  respect  to  bound  constraints  is  enforced    during
        activation, feasibility with respect to general linear constraints is  not
        enforced.

        This function activates boundary constraints, such that both is True:
        1) XC[I] is not at the boundary
        2) XN[I] is at the boundary or beyond it

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            S       -   active set object
            XN      -   new point.
            NeedAct -   True in case one constraint needs activation
            CIdx    -   index of constraint, in [0,N+NEC+NIC).
                        Ignored if NeedAct is false.
                        This value is calculated by SASExploreDirection().
            CVal    -   for CIdx in [0,N) this field stores value which is
                        assigned to XC[CIdx] during activation. CVal is ignored in
                        other cases.
                        This value is calculated by SASExploreDirection().
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            S       -   current point and list of active constraints are changed.

        RESULT:
            >0, in case at least one inactive non-candidate constraint was activated
            =0, in case only "candidate" constraints were activated
            <0, in case no constraints were activated by the step

        NOTE: in general case State.XC<>XN because activation of  constraints  may
              slightly change current point (to enforce feasibility).

        This  subroutine  performs  correction of some (possibly infeasible) point
        with respect to a) current active set, b) all boundary  constraints,  both
        active and inactive:

        0) we calculate L1 penalty term for violation of active linear constraints
           (one which is returned by SASActiveLCPenalty1() function).
        1) first, it performs projection (orthogonal with respect to scale  matrix
           S) of X into current active set: X -> X1.
        2) next, we perform projection with respect to  ALL  boundary  constraints
           which are violated at X1: X1 -> X2.
        3) X is replaced by X2.

        The idea is that this function can preserve and enforce feasibility during
        optimization, and additional penalty parameter can be used to prevent algo
        from leaving feasible set because of rounding errors.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            S       -   active set object
            X       -   array[N], candidate point

            X       -   "improved" candidate point:
                        a) feasible with respect to all boundary constraints
                        b) feasibility with respect to active set is retained at
                           good level.
            Penalty -   penalty term, which can be added to function value if user
                        wants to penalize violation of constraints (recommended).
                        
        NOTE: this function is not intended to find exact  projection  (i.e.  best
              approximation) of X into feasible set. It just improves situation  a
              bit.
              Regular  use  of   this function will help you to retain feasibility
              - if you already have something to start  with  and  constrain  your
              steps is such way that the only source of infeasibility are roundoff
              errors.

            // pivoting, i.e. to select candidate vector with largest norm at each
            // step.
            //
            // First (basic) version of the algorithm is:
            //     0. split all constraints into two sets: basis ones (initially empty)
            //        and candidate ones (all constraints)
            //     1. fill PBasis with H-normalized candidate constraints, fill
            //        corresponding entries of S/IBasis with corresponding
            //        (non-normalized) constraints
            //     2. select row of PBasis with largest norm, move it (and its S/IBasis
            //        counterparts) to the beginning of the candidate set, H-normalize
            //        this row (rows of S/IBasis are normalized using corresponding norms).
            //        Stop if largest row is nearly (or exactly) zero.
            //     3. orthogonalize remaining rows of P/S/IBasis with respect to
            //        one chosen at step (2). It can be done efficiently using
            //        combination of DGEMV/DGER BLAS calls.
            //     4. increase basis size by one, decrease candidate set size by one,
            //        goto (2)
            //
            // However, naive implementation of the algorithm above spends significant
            // amount of time in step (2) - selection of row with largest H-norm. Step
            // (3) can be efficiently implemented with optimized BLAS, but we have no
            // optimized BLAS kernels for step(2). And because step (3) changes row norms,
            // step (2) have to be re-calculated every time, which is quite slow.
            //
            // We can save significant amount of calculations by noticing that:
            // * step (3) DECREASES row norms, but never increases it
            // * we can maintain upper bounds for row H-norms is a separate array,
            //   use them for initial evaluation of best candidates, and update them
            //   after we find some promising row (all bounds are invalidated after
            //   step 3, but their old values still carry some information)
            // * it is beneficial re-evaluate bounds only for rows which are
            //   significantly (at least few percents) larger than best one found so far

        This  function  appends new constraints (if possible; sometimes it isn't!)
        to three orthonormal basises for current active set:
        * P-orthogonal one, which is orthogonalized with inner product
          (x,y) = x'*P*y, where P=inv(H) is current preconditioner
        * S-orthogonal one, which is orthogonalized with inner product
          (x,y) = x'*S'*S*y, where S is diagonal scaling matrix
        * I-orthogonal one, which is orthogonalized with standard dot product

        NOTE: all sets of orthogonal vectors are guaranteed  to  have  same  size.
              P-orthogonal basis is built first, I/S-orthogonal basises are forced
              to have same number of vectors as P-orthogonal one (padded  by  zero
              vectors if needed).
              
        NOTE: this function may fail to update basis without  full  recalculation;
              in such case it will set BasisIsReady to False and silently  return;
              if it succeeds, it will increase BasisSize.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:

            NewEntries  -   array[N+NEC+NIC], indexes of constraints being  added
                            are marked as True; it is responsibility of the caller
                            to specify only those constraints which were previously
                            inactive; when  some  constraint is  already  in   the
                            active set, algorithm behavior is undefined.

        This  subroutine  calculates  preconditioned  descent direction subject to
        current active set.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   active set object
            G       -   array[N], gradient
            H       -   array[N], Hessian matrix
            HA      -   active constraints orthogonalized in such way
                        that HA*inv(H)*HA'= I.
            Normalize-  whether we need normalized descent or not
            D       -   possibly preallocated buffer; automatically resized.
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            D       -   descent direction projected onto current active set.
                        Components of D which correspond to active boundary
                        constraints are forced to be exactly zero.
                        In case D is non-zero and Normalize is True, it is
                        normalized to have unit norm.
                        
        NOTE: if we have N active constraints, D is explicitly set to zero.

        /*************************************************************************
        This function recalculates constraints - activates  and  deactivates  them
        according to gradient value at current point.

        Algorithm  assumes  that  we  want  to make Quasi-Newton step from current
        point with diagonal Quasi-Newton matrix H. Constraints are  activated  and
        deactivated in such way that we won't violate any constraint by step.

        Only already "active" and "candidate" elements of ActiveSet are  examined;
        constraints which are not active are not examined.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   active set object
            GC          -   array[N], gradient at XC
            H           -   array[N], Hessian matrix
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   active set object, with new set of constraint

            // APPROACH TO CONSTRAINTS ACTIVATION/DEACTIVATION
            //
            // We have NActiveConstraints "candidates": NActiveBnd boundary candidates,
            // NActiveLin linear candidates. Indexes of boundary constraints are stored
            // in RCTmpConstraintIdx[0:NActiveBnd-1], indexes of linear ones are stored
            // in RCTmpConstraintIdx[NActiveBnd:NActiveBnd+NActiveLin-1]. Some of the
            // constraints are equality ones, some are inequality - as specified by 
            // RCTmpIsEquality[i].
            //
            // Now we have to determine active subset of "candidates" set. In order to
            // do so we solve following constrained minimization problem:
            //         (                         )^2
            //     min ( SUM(lambda[i]*A[i]) + G )
            //         (                         )
            // Here:
            // * G is a gradient (column vector)
            // * A[i] is a column vector, linear (left) part of I-th constraint.
            //   I=0..NActiveConstraints-1, first NActiveBnd elements of A are just
            //   subset of identity matrix (boundary constraints), next NActiveLin
            //   elements are subset of rows of the matrix of general linear constraints.
            // * lambda[i] is a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to I-th constraint
            //
            // NOTE: for preconditioned setting A is replaced by A*H^(-0.5), G is
            //       replaced by G*H^(-0.5). We apply this scaling at the last stage,
            //       before passing data to NNLS solver.
            //
            // Minimization is performed subject to non-negativity constraints on
            // lambda[i] corresponding to inequality constraints. Inequality constraints
            // which correspond to non-zero lambda are activated, equality constraints
            // are always considered active.
            //
            // Informally speaking, we "decompose" descent direction -G and represent
            // it as sum of constraint vectors and "residual" part (which is equal to
            // the actual descent direction subject to constraints).
            //
            // SOLUTION OF THE NNLS PROBLEM
            //
            // We solve this optimization problem with Non-Negative Least Squares solver,
            // which can efficiently solve least squares problems of the form
            //
            //         ( [ I | AU ]     )^2
            //     min ( [   |    ]*x-b )   s.t. non-negativity constraints on some x[i]
            //         ( [ 0 | AL ]     )
            //
            // In order to use this solver we have to rearrange rows of A[] and G in
            // such way that first NActiveBnd columns of A store identity matrix (before
            // sorting non-zero elements are randomly distributed in the first NActiveBnd
            // columns of A, during sorting we move them to first NActiveBnd rows).
            //
            // Then we create instance of NNLS solver (we reuse instance left from the
            // previous run of the optimization problem) and solve NNLS problem.

        This function accepts quadratic model of the form

            f(x) = 0.5*x'*A*x + b'*x + penaltyfactor*0.5*(C*x-b)'*(C*x-b)
            
        and list of possible steps along direction D. It chooses  best  step  (one
        which achieves minimum value of the target  function)  and  moves  current
        point (given by SAS object) to the new location. Step is  bounded  subject
        to boundary constraints.

        Candidate steps are divided into two groups:
        * "default" step, which is always performed when no candidate steps LONGER
          THAN THE DEFAULT  ONE  is  given.  This  candidate  MUST  reduce  target
          function value; it is  responsibility  of  caller  to   provide  default
          candidate which reduces target function.
        * "additional candidates", which may be shorter or longer than the default
          step. Candidates which are shorter that the default  step  are  ignored;
          candidates which are longer than the "default" step are tested.
          
        The idea is that we ALWAYS try "default" step, and it is responsibility of
        the caller to provide us with something which is worth trying.  This  step
        may activate some constraint - that's why we  stopped  at  "default"  step
        size. However, we may also try longer steps which may activate  additional
        constraints and further reduce function value.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            SState  -   structure which stores model
            SAS     -   active set structure which stores current point in SAS.XC
            D       -   direction for step
            Stp     -   step length for "default" candidate
            NeedAct -   whether   default  candidate  activates  some  constraint;
                        if NeedAct  is True,  constraint  given  by  CIdc/CVal  is
                        GUARANTEED to be activated in the final point.
            CIdx    -   if NeedAct is True, stores index of the constraint to activate
            CVal    -   if NeedAct is True, stores constrained value;
                        SAS.XC[CIdx] is forced to be equal to CVal.
            AddSteps-   array[AddStepsCnt] of additional steps:
                        * AddSteps[]<=Stp are ignored
                        * AddSteps[]>Stp are tried
            Activated-  possibly preallocated buffer; previously allocated memory
                        will be reused.
            Tmp0/1   -  possibly preallocated buffers; previously allocated memory
                        will be reused.
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            SAS     -   SAS.XC is set to new point;  if  there  was  a  constraint
                        specified  by  NeedAct/CIdx/CVal,  it  will  be  activated
                        (other constraints may be activated too, but this  one  is
                        guaranteed to be active in the final point).
            Activated-  elements of this array are set to True, if I-th constraint
                        as inactive at previous point, but become  active  in  the
                        new one.
                        Situations when we deactivate xi>=0 and activate xi<=1 are
                        considered as activation of previously inactive constraint

        /*************************************************************************
        This function prepares data for  constrained  Newton  step  for  penalized
        quadratic model of the form

            f(x) = 0.5*x'*A*x + b'*x + penaltyfactor*0.5*(C*x-b)'*(C*x-b)
            
        where A can be dense or sparse, and model is considered subject to equality
        constraints specified by SState.SAS.XC  object.  Constraint  is considered
        active if XC[i] is exactly BndL[i] or BndU[i],  i.e.  we  ignore  internal
        list of constraints monitored by SAS object. Our own  set  of  constraints
        includes all  constraints  stored  by  SAS,  but  also  may  include  some
        constraints which are inactive in SAS.

        "Preparation" means that Cholesky decomposition of  the  effective  system
        matrix is performed, and we can  perform  constrained  Newton  step.

        This function works as black box. It uses fields of SState which are marked
        as "Variables for constrained Newton phase", and only  this  function  and
        its friends know about these variables. Everyone else should use:
        * CNewtonBuild() to prepare initial Cholesky decomposition for step
        * CNewtonStep() to perform constrained Newton step
        * CNewtonUpdate() to update Cholesky matrix  after  point  was  moved  and
          constraints were updated. In some cases it  is  possible to  efficiently
          re-calculate Cholesky decomposition if you know which  constraints  were
          activated. If efficient  re-calculation  is  impossible,  this  function
          returns False.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            SState  -   structure which stores model and temporaries for CN phase;
                        in particular, SAS.XC stores current point.
            SparseSolver-which sparse solver to use for sparse model; ignored  for
                        dense QP. Can be:
                        * 2 -   SKS-based Cholesky
            NCholesky-  counter which is incremented after Cholesky (successful or
                        failed one)
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            NCholesky-  possibly updated counter
            
        RESULT:
            True, if Cholesky decomposition was successfully performed.
            False, if a) matrix was semi-definite or indefinite, or b)  particular
            combination of matrix type (sparse) and constraints  (general  linear)
            is not supported.
            
        NOTE: this function may routinely return False, for indefinite matrices or
              for sparse problems with general linear constraints. You  should  be
              able to handle such situations.

        /*************************************************************************
        This   function  updates  equality-constrained   Cholesky   matrix   after
        activation of the  new  equality  constraints.  Matrix  being  updated  is
        quadratic term of the function below

            f(x) = 0.5*x'*A*x + b'*x + penaltyfactor*0.5*(C*x-b)'*(C*x-b)
            
        where A can be dense or sparse.

        This  function  uses  YIdx[]  array  (set by CNewtonBuild()  function)  to
        distinguish between active and inactive constraints.

        This function works as black box. It uses fields of SState which are marked
        as "Variables for constrained Newton phase", and only  this  function  and
        its friends know about these variables. Everyone else should use:
        * CNewtonBuild() to prepare initial Cholesky decomposition for step
        * CNewtonStep() to perform constrained Newton step
        * CNewtonUpdate() to update Cholesky matrix  after  point  was  moved  and
          constraints were updated. In some cases it  is  possible to  efficiently
          re-calculate Cholesky decomposition if you know which  constraints  were
          activated. If efficient  re-calculation  is  impossible,  this  function
          returns False.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            SState  -   structure which stores model and temporaries for CN phase;
                        in particular, SAS.XC stores current point.
            Settings -  QQPSettings object which was  initialized  by  appropriate
                        construction function.
            NCUpdates-  counter which is incremented after each update (one update
                        means one variable being fixed)
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            NCUpdates-  possibly updated counter
            
        RESULT:
            True, if Cholesky decomposition was successfully performed.
            False, if a) model age was too high, or b) particular  combination  of
            matrix type (sparse) and constraints (general linear) is not supported
            
        NOTE: this function may routinely return False.
              You should be able to handle such situations.

            f(x) = 0.5*x'*A*x + b'*x + penaltyfactor*0.5*(C*x-b)'*(C*x-b)
            
        where A can be dense or sparse.

        As  input,  this  function  accepts  gradient  at the current location. As
        output, it returns step vector (replaces gradient).

        This function works as black box. It uses fields of SState which are marked
        as "Variables for constrained Newton phase", and only  this  function  and
        its friends know about these variables. Everyone else should use:
        * CNewtonBuild() to prepare initial Cholesky decomposition for step
        * CNewtonStep() to perform constrained Newton step
        * CNewtonUpdate() to update Cholesky matrix  after  point  was  moved  and
          constraints were updated. In some cases it  is  possible to  efficiently
          re-calculate Cholesky decomposition if you know which  constraints  were
          activated. If efficient  re-calculation  is  impossible,  this  function
          returns False.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            SState  -   structure which stores model and temporaries for CN phase;
                        in particular, SAS.XC stores current point.
            Settings -  QQPSettings object which was  initialized  by  appropriate
                        construction function.
            GC       -  array[N], gradient of the target function
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            GC       -  array[N], step vector (on success)
            
        RESULT:
            True, if step was successfully calculated.
            False, if step calculation failed:
            a) gradient was exactly zero,
            b) gradient norm was smaller than EpsG (stopping condition)
            c) all variables were equality-constrained
            
        NOTE: this function may routinely return False.
              You should be able to handle such situations.

        /*************************************************************************
                LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

        DESCRIPTION:
        The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
        Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
        of memory.
        The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
        using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
        It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
        value of order 2*N*M.


        REQUIREMENTS:
        Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
        * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
           and other functions
        3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
        4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem
           with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
           MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension. N>0
            M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                        approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                        value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                        considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                        performance. M<=N.
            X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
            

        NOTES:
        1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
        2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
           optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
           use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
           L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

        /*************************************************************************
        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinLBFGSCreate().  It  uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinLBFGSCreate() in  order  to  get
        more information about creation of LBFGS optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                        approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                        value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                        considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                        performance. M<=N.
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
           Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
           nonlinear problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  LBFGS  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinLBFGSSetPrec...()
        functions.

        There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

        Modification of the preconditioner: scale-based diagonal preconditioning.

        This preconditioning mode can be useful when you  don't  have  approximate
        diagonal of Hessian, but you know that your  variables  are  badly  scaled
        (for  example,  one  variable is in [1,10], and another in [1000,100000]),
        and most part of the ill-conditioning comes from different scales of vars.

        In this case simple  scale-based  preconditioner,  with H[i] = 1/(s[i]^2),
        can greatly improve convergence.

        IMPRTANT: you should set scale of your variables  with  MinLBFGSSetScale()
        call  (before  or after MinLBFGSSetPrecScale() call). Without knowledge of
        the scale of your variables scale-based preconditioner will be  just  unit
        matrix.

        This function sets low-rank preconditioner for Hessian matrix  H=D+W'*C*W,
        where:
        * H is a Hessian matrix, which is approximated by D/W/C
        * D is a NxN diagonal positive definite matrix
        * W is a KxN low-rank correction
        * C is a KxK positive definite diagonal factor of low-rank correction

        This preconditioner is inexact but fast - it requires O(N*K)  time  to  be
        applied. Preconditioner P is calculated by artificially constructing a set
        of BFGS updates which tries to reproduce behavior of H:
        * Sk = Wk (k-th row of W)
        * Yk = (D+Wk'*Ck*Wk)*Sk
        * Yk/Sk are reordered by ascending of C[k]*norm(Wk)^2

        Here we assume that rows of Wk are orthogonal or nearly orthogonal,  which
        allows us to have O(N*K+K^2) update instead of O(N*K^2) one. Reordering of
        updates is essential for having good performance on non-orthogonal problems
        (updates which do not add much of curvature are added first,  and  updates
        which add very large eigenvalues are added last and override effect of the
        first updates).

        In practice, this preconditioner is perfect when ortogonal  correction  is
        applied; on non-orthogonal problems sometimes  it  allows  to  achieve  5x
        speedup (when compared to non-preconditioned solver).

        NOTES:

        1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
           (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
           only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
           gradient.

           Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
           (either MinLBFGSCreate() for analytical gradient  or  MinLBFGSCreateF()
           for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
           MinLBFGSOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
           which accepts function ONLY.

           Be careful to choose variant of MinLBFGSOptimize() which corresponds to
           your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
           callback (function/gradient) passed to MinLBFGSOptimize()  and specific
           function used to create optimizer.


                             |         USER PASSED TO MinLBFGSOptimize()

           MinLBFGSCreate()  |     FAIL                work

           Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
           function  and  MinLBFGSOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
           combination (for example, to create optimizer with MinLBFGSCreateF() and
           to pass gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to exception
           being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS needed or
           you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

        This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
        analytic gradient.

        Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
        numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
        (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
        compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

        If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
        continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
        which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
        suspicious by the OptGuard.

        The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlbfgsoptguardresults().

        IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
                   about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
                   cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.
                   
                   YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
                   CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

        NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
              does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.
              
        INPUT PARAMETERS:

                            * TestStep>0 activates verification
                            You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                            too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                            cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                            short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                            numerical derivative.
                            
                            You may use different step for different parameters by
                            means of setting scale with minlbfgssetscale().

        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================                    

        In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:

            of i-th parameter
          * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial

        /*************************************************************************
        This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
        the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
        solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
        a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
        b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

        Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
        that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
        OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

        Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
        than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
        scale problems.

        NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
              continuity violations.
              
              First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
              the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
              of the model - or simply because the model has changed.
              
              Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
              noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
              near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
              lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
              discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
              to numerical noise alone.
              
              Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
              minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
              spotted with restart from different initial point).

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state
            level   -   monitoring level:
                        * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                        * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                              and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                              try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                              get more information about suspicious locations.
          
        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

        One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
        the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
        Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
        nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

        Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
        lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
        coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
        stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

        OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
        function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
        errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
        flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
        you can study OptGuard result.

        Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
        session is over.

        === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

        OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
        in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
        * incorrect analytic gradient
        * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
        * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

        Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
        * minlbfgsoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
        * minlbfgsoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

        Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
        * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
          * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
          * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
          * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
            single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
            complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
          * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
            differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
            report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
            or MinLM)
        * rep.nonc0suspected
        * rep.nonc1suspected

        === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================
            
        Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
        out specific test signaled error by looking to:
        * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

        Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
        means of:
        * minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test0results()
        * minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test1results()
        which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
        were found, and so on.

        ==========================================================================
             
        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                        retrieved with other functions.

        NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
              ones) are possible although unlikely.
              
              The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
              nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
              function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
              optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
              wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
              It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
              termination too quickly.
              
              Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
              our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
              points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

        Nonsmoothness (non-C1) test #0 studies  function  values  (not  gradient!)
        obtained during line searches and monitors  behavior  of  the  directional
        derivative estimate.

        This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
        gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
        numerical differentiation.

        Two reports are returned:
        * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
          value of the nonsmoothness indicator
        * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
          evaluations, and thus is more detailed

        In both cases following fields are returned:

        Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

        Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
        gradient computed during line search.

        When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
        test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
        gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
        differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
        of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

        This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
        continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
        continuity is violated.

        Two reports are returned:
        * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
          value of the nonsmoothness indicator

        This function estimates Lagrange multipliers for scaled-shifted QP problem
        (here "scaled-shifted"  means  that we  performed  variable  scaling   and
        subtracted origin) given by quadratic term A, linear term B, box constraints
        and linear constraint matrix.

        It is assumed that all linear constraints are equality  ones,  with  first
        NEC ones being constraints without slack  variables,  and  next  NIC  ones
        having slack variables. The only inequality constraints we  have  are  box
        ones, with first NMain ones being "general" box constraints, and next  NIC
        ones being non-negativity constraints (not specified explicitly).

        We also make use of the current point XC, which is used to determine active
        box constraints.

        Actual QP problem size is NMain+NIC, but   some  parameters   have   lower
        dimensionality.

        Parameters sizes are:
        * A is assumed to be array[NMain,NMain]
        * B is assumed to be array[NMain]
        * BndL, BndU are array[NMain]
        * CLEIC is array[NEC+NIC,NMain+1] (last item in a row containts right part)
        * ExXC is array[NMain+NIC], holds current point
        * NuLCEst is array[NEC+NIC], holds initial values of Lagrange coeffs

        On exit NuLCEst is updated with new estimate of Lagrange multipliers.

        This function generates scaled (by S) and shifted (by XC) reformulation of
        the original problem.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            DenseA      -   for dense problems (AKind=0), A-term of CQM object
                            contains system matrix. Other terms are unspecified
                            and should not be referenced.

            N           -   number of variables in the  original  formulation  (no
                            slack variables).
            CLEIC       -   dense linear equality/inequality constraints. Equality
                            constraints come first.
            NEC, NIC    -   number of dense equality/inequality constraints.
            SCLEIC      -   sparse linear equality/inequality constraints. Equality
                            constraints come first.
            SNEC, SNIC  -   number of sparse equality/inequality constraints.
            RenormLC    -   whether constraints should be renormalized (recommended)
                            or used "as is".
            Settings    -   QPDENSEAULSettings object initialized by one of the initialization
                            functions.

        Normalize model in such way that norm(A)~1 (very roughly)

        We have two lower bounds for sigma_max(A):
        * first estimate is provided by Frobenius norm, it is equal to ANorm/NMain
        * second estimate is provided by max(CAC)

        We select largest one of these estimates, because using just one
        of them is prone to different failure modes. Then, we divide A and B
        by this estimate.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            A   -       array[N,N], quadratic term, full triangle is given
            B   -       array[N], linear term
            N   -       problem size
            CLEIC-      array[NEC+NIC,N+1], linear equality/inequality constraints
            NEC -       number of equality constraints
            NIC -       number of inequality constraints
            UseCLEIC-   additional normalization of A in such way that CLEIC*A*CLEIC'~1:
                        * if False, CLEIC is ignored
                        * if True, CLEIC rows MUST have unit norm (we check it)
            Tmp2-       additional buffer, possibly preallocated
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            A, B - appropriately rescaled

                             BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
               WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

        DESCRIPTION:
        The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
        combination of:
        * bound constraints
        * linear inequality constraints
        * linear equality constraints

        REQUIREMENTS:
        * user must provide function value and gradient
        * starting point X0 must be feasible or
          not too far away from the feasible set
        * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
          L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
        * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

        USAGE:

        Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
        Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
        you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
        on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

        2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
           MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

        3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBLEICSetCond().

        4. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

        5. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

        6. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
           with same N but another starting point.
           MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.

        NOTE: if you have box-only constraints (no  general  linear  constraints),
              then MinBC optimizer can be better option. It uses  special,  faster
              constraint activation method, which performs better on problems with
              multiple constraints active at the solution.
              
              On small-scale problems performance of MinBC is similar to  that  of
              MinBLEIC, but on large-scale ones (hundreds and thousands of  active
              constraints) it can be several times faster than MinBLEIC.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
            X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                        * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                        * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                          to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                          approximation.

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state

        /*************************************************************************
        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
        more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
           gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
           problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        NOTE 2: this solver has following useful properties:
        * bound constraints are always satisfied exactly
        * function is evaluated only INSIDE area specified by  bound  constraints,
          even  when  numerical  differentiation is used (algorithm adjusts  nodes
          according to boundary constraints)

        This function sets linear constraints for BLEIC optimizer.

        Linear constraints are inactive by default (after initial creation).
        They are preserved after algorithm restart with MinBLEICRestartFrom().

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure previously allocated with MinBLEICCreate call.
            C       -   linear constraints, array[K,N+1].
                        Each row of C represents one constraint, either equality
                        or inequality (see below):
                        * first N elements correspond to coefficients,
                        * last element corresponds to the right part.
                        All elements of C (including right part) must be finite.
            CT      -   type of constraints, array[K]:
                        * if CT[i]>0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x >= C[i,n]
                        * if CT[i]=0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x  = C[i,n]
                        * if CT[i]<0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x <= C[i,n]
            K       -   number of equality/inequality constraints, K>=0:
                        * if given, only leading K elements of C/CT are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from sizes of C/CT

        NOTE 1: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:
        * there always exists some minor violation (about Epsilon in magnitude)
          due to rounding errors
        * numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
          outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
          numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.
        If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
        problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
        (this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
        solution and in all intermediate points).

        This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
        functions.

        There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

        This function sets maximum step length

        IMPORTANT: this feature is hard to combine with preconditioning. You can't
        set upper limit on step length, when you solve optimization  problem  with
        linear (non-boundary) constraints AND preconditioner turned on.

        When  non-boundary  constraints  are  present,  you  have to either a) use
        preconditioner, or b) use upper limit on step length.  YOU CAN'T USE BOTH!
        In this case algorithm will terminate with appropriate error code.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
            StpMax  -   maximum step length, >=0. Set StpMax to 0.0,  if you don't
                        want to limit step length.

        Use this subroutine when you optimize target function which contains exp()
        or  other  fast  growing  functions,  and optimization algorithm makes too
        large  steps  which  lead   to overflow. This function allows us to reject
        steps  that  are  too  large  (and  therefore  expose  us  to the possible
        overflow) without actually calculating function value at the x+stp*d.

        NOTES:

        1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
           (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
           only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
           gradient.

           Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
           (either  MinBLEICCreate() for analytical gradient or  MinBLEICCreateF()
           for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
           MinBLEICOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
           which accepts function ONLY.

           Be careful to choose variant of MinBLEICOptimize() which corresponds to
           your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
           callback (function/gradient) passed to MinBLEICOptimize()  and specific
           function used to create optimizer.


                             |         USER PASSED TO MinBLEICOptimize()
           CREATED WITH      |  function only   |  function and gradient
           ------------------------------------------------------------
           MinBLEICCreateF() |     work                FAIL
           MinBLEICCreate()  |     FAIL                work

           Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
           function  and  MinBLEICOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
           combination (for  example,  to  create optimizer with MinBLEICCreateF()
           and  to  pass  gradient information to MinBLEICOptimize()) will lead to
           exception being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS
           needed or you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

        /*************************************************************************
        This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
        analytic gradient.

        Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
        numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
        (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
        compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

        If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
        continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
        which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
        suspicious by the OptGuard.

        The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minbleicoptguardresults().

        IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
                   about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
                   cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.
                   
                   YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
                   CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

        NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
              does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.
              
        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
            TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                            * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                            * TestStep>0 activates verification
                            You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                            too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                            cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                            short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                            numerical derivative.
                            
                            You may use different step for different parameters by
                            means of setting scale with minbleicsetscale().

        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================                    

        In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
          * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
            where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
            of i-th parameter
          * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
            points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
            point

        /*************************************************************************
        This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
        the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
        solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
        a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
        b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

        Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
        that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
        OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

        Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
        than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
        scale problems.

        NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
              continuity violations.
              
              First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
              the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
              of the model - or simply because the model has changed.
              
              Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
              noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
              near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
              lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
              discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
              to numerical noise alone.
              
              Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
              minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
              spotted with restart from different initial point).

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state

                        * 0 - monitoring is disabled

                              and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                              try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                              get more information about suspicious locations.
          
        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

        One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
        the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
        Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
        nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

        Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
        lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
        coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
        stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

        OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
        function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
        errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
        flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
        you can study OptGuard result.

        Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
        session is over.

        === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

        OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
        in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
        * incorrect analytic gradient
        * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
        * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

        Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
        * minbleicoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
        * minbleicoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

        Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
        * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
          * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
          * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
          * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
            single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
            complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
          * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
            differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
            report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
            or MinLM)
        * rep.nonc0suspected
        * rep.nonc1suspected

        === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================
            
        Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
        out specific test signaled error by looking to:
        * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

        Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
        means of:
        * minbleicoptguardnonc1test0results()
        * minbleicoptguardnonc1test1results()
        which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
        were found, and so on.

        ==========================================================================
             
        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                        retrieved with other functions.

        NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
              ones) are possible although unlikely.
              
              The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
              nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
              function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
              optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
              wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
              It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
              termination too quickly.
              
              Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
              our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
              points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

        Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
        gradient computed during line search.

        When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
        test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
        gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
        differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
        of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

        This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
        continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
        continuity is violated.

        Two reports are returned:
        * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest

                            CONSTRAINED QUADRATIC PROGRAMMING

        The subroutine creates QP optimizer. After initial creation,  it  contains
        default optimization problem with zero quadratic and linear terms  and  no
        constraints. You should set quadratic/linear terms with calls to functions
        provided by MinQP subpackage.

        You should also choose appropriate QP solver and set it  and  its stopping
        criteria by means of MinQPSetAlgo??????() function. Then, you should start
        solution process by means of MinQPOptimize() call. Solution itself can  be
        obtained with MinQPResults() function.

        Following solvers are recommended:
        * QuickQP for dense problems with box-only constraints (or no constraints
          at all)
        * QP-BLEIC for dense/sparse problems with moderate (up to 50) number of
          general linear constraints
        * DENSE-AUL-QP for dense problems with any (small or large) number of
          general linear constraints

        One such solution is to evaluate scale of I-th variable as 1/Sqrt(A[i,i]),

        This function tells solver to use BLEIC-based algorithm and sets  stopping
        criteria for the algorithm.

        This algorithm is fast  enough  for large-scale  problems  with  following
        properties:
        a) feasible initial point, moderate amount of general linear constraints
        b) arbitrary (can be infeasible) initial point, small  amount  of  general
           linear constraints (say, hundred or less)

        If you solve large-scale QP problem with many inequality  constraints  and
        without initial feasibility guarantees, consider  using  DENSE-AUL  solver
        instead. Initial feasibility detection stage by BLEIC may take too long on
        such problems.

        ALGORITHM FEATURES:

        * supports dense and sparse QP problems
        * supports box and general linear equality/inequality constraints
        * can solve all types of problems  (convex,  semidefinite,  nonconvex)  as
          long as they are bounded from below under constraints.
          Say, it is possible to solve "min{-x^2} subject to -1<=x<=+1".
          Of course, global  minimum  is found only  for  positive  definite   and
          semidefinite  problems.  As  for indefinite ones - only local minimum is
          found.

        ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

        * BLEIC-QP solver is just a driver function for MinBLEIC solver; it solves
          quadratic  programming   problem   as   general   linearly   constrained
          optimization problem, which is solved by means of BLEIC solver  (part of
          ALGLIB, active set method).
          
        ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:
        * This algorithm is inefficient on  problems with hundreds  and  thousands
          of general inequality constraints and infeasible initial point.  Initial
          feasibility detection stage may take too long on such constraint sets.
          Consider using DENSE-AUL instead.
        * unlike QuickQP solver, this algorithm does not perform Newton steps  and
          does not use Level 3 BLAS. Being general-purpose active set  method,  it
          can activate constraints only one-by-one. Thus, its performance is lower
          than that of QuickQP.
        * its precision is also a bit  inferior  to  that  of   QuickQP.  BLEIC-QP
          performs only LBFGS steps (no Newton steps), which are good at detecting
          neighborhood of the solution, buy needs many iterations to find solution
          with more than 6 digits of precision.

            MaxIts  -   maximum number of iterations. If MaxIts=0, the  number  of
                        iterations is unlimited. NOTE: this  algorithm uses  LBFGS
                        iterations,  which  are  relatively  cheap,  but   improve
                        function value only a bit. So you will need many iterations
                        to converge - from 0.1*N to 10*N, depending  on  problem's
                        condition number.

        IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL MinQPSetScale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
        BECAUSE ITS STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

        Passing EpsG=0, EpsF=0 and EpsX=0 and MaxIts=0 (simultaneously) will lead
        to automatic stopping criterion selection (presently it is  small    step
        length, but it may change in the future versions of ALGLIB).

        /*************************************************************************
        This function tells QP solver to use Dense-AUL algorithm and sets stopping
        criteria for the algorithm.

        ALGORITHM FEATURES:

        * supports  box  and  dense/sparse  general   linear   equality/inequality
          constraints
        * convergence is theoretically proved for positive-definite  (convex)   QP
          problems. Semidefinite and non-convex problems can be solved as long  as
          they  are   bounded  from  below  under  constraints,  although  without
          theoretical guarantees.
        * this solver is better than QP-BLEIC on problems  with  large  number  of
          general linear constraints. It better handles infeasible initial points.

        ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

        * this  algorithm   is   an   augmented   Lagrangian   method  with  dense
          preconditioner (hence  its  name).  It  is  similar  to  barrier/penalty
          methods, but much more precise and faster.
        * it performs several outer iterations in order to refine  values  of  the
          Lagrange multipliers. Single outer  iteration  is  a  solution  of  some
          unconstrained optimization problem: first  it  performs  dense  Cholesky
          factorization of the Hessian in order to build preconditioner  (adaptive
          regularization is applied to enforce positive  definiteness),  and  then
          it uses L-BFGS optimizer to solve optimization problem.
        * typically you need about 5-10 outer iterations to converge to solution
          
        ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:

        * because dense Cholesky driver is used, this algorithm has O(N^2)  memory
          requirements and O(OuterIterations*N^3) minimum running time.  From  the
          practical  point  of  view,  it  limits  its  applicability  by  several
          thousands of variables.
          From  the  other  side,  variables  count  is  the most limiting factor,
          and dependence on constraint count is  much  more  lower. Assuming  that
          constraint matrix is sparse, it may handle tens of thousands  of general
          linear constraints.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
            EpsX    -   >=0, stopping criteria for inner optimizer.
                        Inner  iterations  are  stopped  when  step  length  (with
                        variable scaling being applied) is less than EpsX.
                        See  minqpsetscale()  for  more  information  on  variable
                        scaling.
            Rho     -   penalty coefficient, Rho>0:
                        * large enough  that  algorithm  converges  with   desired
                          precision.
                        * not TOO large to prevent ill-conditioning
                        * recommended values are 100, 1000 or 10000
            ItsCnt  -   number of outer iterations:
                        * recommended values: 10-15 (although  in  most  cases  it
                          converges within 5 iterations, you may need a  few  more
                          to be sure).
                        * ItsCnt=0 means that small number of outer iterations  is
                          automatically chosen (10 iterations in current version).
                        * ItsCnt=1 means that AUL algorithm performs just as usual
                          penalty method.
                        * ItsCnt>1 means that  AUL  algorithm  performs  specified
                          number of outer iterations

        IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL minqpsetscale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
        BECAUSE ITS CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES AND STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

        NOTE: Passing  EpsX=0  will  lead  to  automatic  step  length  selection
              (specific step length chosen may change in the future  versions  of
              ALGLIB, so it is better to specify step length explicitly).

        /*************************************************************************
        This function tells solver to use QuickQP  algorithm:  special  extra-fast
        algorithm for problems with box-only constrants. It may  solve  non-convex
        problems as long as they are bounded from below under constraints.

        ALGORITHM FEATURES:
        * many times (from 5x to 50x!) faster than BLEIC-based QP solver; utilizes
          accelerated methods for activation of constraints.
        * supports dense and sparse QP problems
        * supports ONLY box constraints; general linear constraints are NOT
          supported by this solver
        * can solve all types of problems  (convex,  semidefinite,  nonconvex)  as
          long as they are bounded from below under constraints.
          Say, it is possible to solve "min{-x^2} subject to -1<=x<=+1".
          In convex/semidefinite case global minimum  is  returned,  in  nonconvex
          case - algorithm returns one of the local minimums.

        ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

        * algorithm  performs  two kinds of iterations: constrained CG  iterations
          and constrained Newton iterations
        * initially it performs small number of constrained CG  iterations,  which
          can efficiently activate/deactivate multiple constraints
        * after CG phase algorithm tries to calculate Cholesky  decomposition  and
          to perform several constrained Newton steps. If  Cholesky  decomposition
          failed (matrix is indefinite even under constraints),  we  perform  more
          CG iterations until we converge to such set of constraints  that  system
          matrix becomes  positive  definite.  Constrained  Newton  steps  greatly
          increase convergence speed and precision.
        * algorithm interleaves CG and Newton iterations which  allows  to  handle
          indefinite matrices (CG phase) and quickly converge after final  set  of
          constraints is found (Newton phase). Combination of CG and Newton phases
          is called "outer iteration".
        * it is possible to turn off Newton  phase  (beneficial  for  semidefinite
          problems - Cholesky decomposition will fail too often)
          
        ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:

        * algorithm does not support general  linear  constraints;  only  box ones
          are supported
        * Cholesky decomposition for sparse problems  is  performed  with  Skyline
          Cholesky solver, which is intended for low-profile matrices. No profile-
          reducing reordering of variables is performed in this version of ALGLIB.
        * problems with near-zero negative eigenvalues (or exacty zero  ones)  may
          experience about 2-3x performance penalty. The reason is  that  Cholesky
          decomposition can not be performed until we identify directions of  zero
          and negative curvature and activate corresponding boundary constraints -
          but we need a lot of trial and errors because these directions  are hard
          to notice in the matrix spectrum.
          In this case you may turn off Newton phase of algorithm.
          Large negative eigenvalues  are  not  an  issue,  so  highly  non-convex
          problems can be solved very efficiently.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:

            MaxOuterIts-maximum number of OUTER iterations.  One  outer  iteration
                        includes some amount of CG iterations (from 5 to  ~N)  and
                        one or several (usually small amount) Newton steps.  Thus,
                        one outer iteration has high cost, but can greatly  reduce
                        funcation value.
                        Use 0 if you do not want to limit number of outer iterations.
            UseNewton-  use Newton phase or not:
                        * Newton phase improves performance of  positive  definite
                          dense problems (about 2 times improvement can be observed)
                        * can result in some performance penalty  on  semidefinite
                          or slightly negative definite  problems  -  each  Newton
                          phase will bring no improvement (Cholesky failure),  but
                          still will require computational time.
                        * if you doubt, you can turn off this  phase  -  optimizer
                          will retain its most of its high speed.

        IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL MinQPSetScale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
        BECAUSE ITS STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

        Passing EpsG=0, EpsF=0 and EpsX=0 and MaxIts=0 (simultaneously) will lead
        to automatic stopping criterion selection (presently it is  small    step
        length, but it may change in the future versions of ALGLIB).

                                inefficient for problems with hundreds of constraints
        * Dense-AUL-QP      -   handles them with moderate precision (approx. 10^-6),
                                may efficiently handle thousands of constraints.

        Following QP solvers can NOT handle dense linear constraints:
        * QuickQP           -   can not handle general linear constraints

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure previously allocated with MinQPCreate call.
            C       -   linear constraints, array[K,N+1].
                        Each row of C represents one constraint, either equality
                        or inequality (see below):

                        * last element corresponds to the right part.
                        All elements of C (including right part) must be finite.

                        * if not given, automatically determined from sizes of C/CT

        This function sets sparse linear constraints for QP optimizer.

        This  function  overrides  results  of  previous  calls  to  minqpsetlc(),

        dense constraints are dropped, and you have only those  constraints  which
        were specified in the present call.

        If you want  to  specify  mixed  (with  dense  and  sparse  terms)  linear
        constraints, you should call minqpsetlcmixed().

                                constraints.
        * Dense-AUL-QP      -   although this solver uses dense linear algebra  to
                                calculate   Cholesky   preconditioner,   it    may

        /*************************************************************************
        This function solves quadratic programming problem.

        Prior to calling this function you should choose solver by means of one of
        the following functions:

        * minqpsetalgoquickqp()     - for QuickQP solver
        * minqpsetalgobleic()       - for BLEIC-QP solver
        * minqpsetalgodenseaul()    - for Dense-AUL-QP solver

        These functions also allow you to control stopping criteria of the solver.
        If you did not set solver,  MinQP  subpackage  will  automatically  select
        solver for your problem and will run it with default stopping criteria.

        However, it is better to set explicitly solver and its stopping criteria.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   algorithm state

        You should use MinQPResults() function to access results after calls
        to this function.

        This function performs shifting using current algorithm  as  specified  by
        settings.shifting.

        It accepts following parameters:
        * AlphaR - pivot row
        * Delta - delta from pricing step
        * Q - variable selected by ratio test
        * ThetaD - dual step length

        If no shifts are necessary, it silently returns. If shifts are  necessary,
        it modifies ThetaD, S.D, S.EffC according to shifting algorithm.

        This function performs pricing step

        Additional parameters:
        * Phase1Pricing - if True, then special Phase #1 restriction is applied to
          leaving variables: only those are eligible which will move to zero bound
          after basis change.
          
          This trick allows to accelerate and stabilize phase #1. See Robert Fourer,
          'Notes on the dual simplex method', draft report, 1994, for more info.

        Returns:
        * leaving variable index P
        * its index R in the basis, in [0,M) range
        * Delta - difference between variable value and corresponding bound

        NOTE: this function expects that basic components are stored in XB[];
              corresponding entries of XA[] are ignored.

        This function performs ratio test, either simple one or BFRT.

        It accepts following parameters:
        * AlphaR - pivot row
        * Delta - delta from pricing step
        * P - index of leaving variable from pricing step

        It returns following results:
        * Q - non-negative value for success, negative for primal infeasible problem
        * ThetaD - dual step length
        * PossibleFlips[PossibleFlipsCnt] - for possible flip indexes (for BFRT
          this set coincides with actual flips, but stabilizing BFRT is a bit more
          complex - some variables in PossibleFlips[] may need flipping and some not)

        Internally it uses following fields of State for temporaries:
        * EligibleSet

        This function performs update of XB, XN, D and Z during final step of revised
        dual simplex method.

        It also updates basis cache of the subproblem (s.bcache field).

        Depending on Settings.RatioTest, following operations are performed:
        * Settings.RatioTest=0  ->  simple update is performed
        * Settings.RatioTest=1  ->  bounds flipping ratio test update is performed
        * Settings.RatioTest=2  ->  stabilizing bounds flipping ratio test update is performed

        It accepts following parameters:
        * P - index of leaving variable from pricing step
        * Q - index of entering variable.
        * R - index of leaving variable in AlphaQ
        * Delta    - delta from pricing step
        * ThetaP   - primal step length
        * ThetaD   - dual step length
        * AlphaQ   - pivot column
        * AlphaQim - intermediate result from Ftran for AlphaQ, used for
                     Forest-Tomlin update, not referenced when other update scheme is set
        * AlphaR   - pivot row
        * Tau - tau-vector for DSE pricing (ignored if simple pricing is used)
        * PossibleFlips, PossibleFlipsCnt - outputs of the RatioTest(), information
          about possible variable flips (however, we have to check residual costs
          before actually flipping variables - it is possible that some variables
          in this set actually do not need flipping)

        It performs following operations:
        * basis update
        * update of XB/BndTB/BndLB/BndUB[] and XA[] (basic and nonbasic components), D
        * update of pricing weights

        so we can reuse previous basis.

        Dual steepest edge weights are invalidated by this function.

        This function:
        * tries to resize basis
        * if possible, returns True and valid basis with valid factorization
        * if resize is impossible (or abandoned due to stability reasons), it
          returns False and basis object is left in the invalid state (you have
          to reinitialize it by all-logicals basis)

        Following types of resize are supported:
        * new basis size is larger than previous one => logical elements are
          added to the new basis
        * basis sizes match => no operation is performed
        * new basis size is zero => basis is set to zero

        This function:
        * requires valid triangular factorization at S on entry
        * replaces it by another, valid factorization
        * checks that new factorization deviates from the previous one not too much
          by comparing magnitudes of min[abs(u_ii)] in both factorization (sharp
          decrease results in attempt to resize being abandoned

        IMPORTANT: if smooth resize is not possible, this function throws an
                   exception! It is responsibility of the caller to check that
                   smooth resize is possible

                                    LINEAR PROGRAMMING

        The subroutine creates LP  solver.  After  initial  creation  it  contains
        default optimization problem with zero cost vector and all variables being
        fixed to zero values and no constraints.

        In order to actually solve something you should:
        * set cost vector with minlpsetcost()
        * set variable bounds with minlpsetbc() or minlpsetbcall()
        * specify constraint matrix with one of the following functions:
          [*] minlpsetlc()        for dense one-sided constraints
          [*] minlpsetlc2dense()  for dense two-sided constraints
          [*] minlpsetlc2()       for sparse two-sided constraints
          [*] minlpaddlc2dense()  to add one dense row to constraint matrix
          [*] minlpaddlc2()       to add one row to constraint matrix (compressed format)
        * call minlpoptimize() to run the solver and  minlpresults()  to  get  the
          solution vector and additional information.

        Presently  this  optimizer  supports  only  revised  simplex   method   as
        underlying solver. DSE pricing and bounds flipping ratio  test  (aka  long
        dual step) are supported. Large-scale sparse LU solver with  Forest-Tomlin
        is used internally as linear algebra driver.

        Future releases of ALGLIB may introduce other solvers.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem size
            
        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   optimizer in the default state

        This function performs actual processing for  SLP  algorithm.  It  expects
        that caller redirects its reverse communication  requests NeedFiJ/XUpdated
        to external user who will provide analytic derivative (or  handle  reports
        about progress).

        In case external user does not have analytic derivative, it is responsibility
        of caller to intercept NeedFiJ request and  replace  it  with  appropriate
        numerical differentiation scheme.

        Results are stored:
        * point - in State.StepKX

        IMPORTANT: this function works with scaled problem formulation; it is
                   responsibility of the caller to unscale request and scale
                   Jacobian.

        This function tries to perform either phase #1 or phase #3 step.

        Former corresponds to linear model step (without conjugacy constraints) with
        correction for nonlinearity ("second order correction").  Such  correction
        helps to overcome  Maratos  effect  (a  tendency  of  L1  penalized  merit
        functions to reject nonzero steps).

        Latter is a step using linear model with no second order correction.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   SLP solver state, StepKX/Fi/J is used as current point,
                            StepK...N/C fields are modified.
            SMonitor    -   smoothness monitor
            UseCorrection-  True if we perform second order correction
            UserTerminationNeeded-True if user requested termination

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   StepKX/Fi/J advanced to new point, StepKLagMult contain
                            current Lagrange multipliers, RepTerminationType is
                            set to current termination code (if Status=0).
            Status      -   when reverse communication is done, Status is set to:
                            * negative value,  if   we  have   to  restart   outer
                              iteration
                            * positive value,  if we can proceed to the next stage
                              of the outer iteration
                            * zero, if algorithm is terminated (RepTerminationType
                              is set to appropriate value)
            Stp         -   step length, in [0,1]

        This function tries to perform phase #2 iterations.

        Phase #2 is  a  sequence  of  linearized  steps   minimizing  L2-penalized
        Lagrangian  performed  with  successively  increasing  set  of   conjugacy
        constraints (which make algorithm behavior similar to that of CG).

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   SLP solver state, StepKX/Fi/J is used as current point,
                            StepK...N/C fields are modified.
            SMonitor    -   smoothness monitor
            UserTerminationNeeded-True if user requested termination
            GammaMax    -   current estimate of the Hessian norm

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   StepKX/Fi/J advanced to new point, StepKLagMult contain
                            current Lagrange multipliers, RepTerminationType is
                            set to current termination code (if Status=0).
            GammaMax    -   updated estimate of the Hessian norm    
            Status      -   when reverse communication is done, Status is set to:
                            * negative value,  if   we  have   to  restart   outer
                              iteration
                            * positive value,  if we can proceed to the next stage
                              of the outer iteration
                            * zero, if algorithm is terminated (RepTerminationType
                              is set to appropriate value)

        TERMINATION CODES

        TerminationType field contains completion code, which can be either:

        === FAILURE CODE ===
          -8    internal integrity control detected  infinite  or  NAN  values  in
                function/gradient. Abnormal termination signaled.
          -3    box  constraints  are  infeasible.  Note: infeasibility of non-box
                constraints does NOT trigger emergency  completion;  you  have  to
                examine  bcerr/lcerr/nlcerr   to  detect   possibly   inconsistent
                constraints.

        === SUCCESS CODE ===
           2    relative step is no more than EpsX.
           5    MaxIts steps was taken
           7    stopping conditions are too stringent,

                          NONLINEARLY  CONSTRAINED  OPTIMIZATION
                    WITH PRECONDITIONED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN ALGORITHM

        DESCRIPTION:
        The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
        combination of:
        * bound constraints
        * linear inequality constraints
        * linear equality constraints
        * nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
        * nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)<=0

        REQUIREMENTS:
        * user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()
        * starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
          set
        * F(), G(), H() are twice continuously differentiable on the feasible  set
          and its neighborhood
        * nonlinear constraints G() and H() must have non-zero gradient at  G(x)=0
          and at H(x)=0. Say, constraint like x^2>=1 is supported, but x^2>=0   is
          NOT supported.

        USAGE:

        Constrained optimization if far more complex than the  unconstrained  one.
        Nonlinearly constrained optimization is one of the most esoteric numerical
        procedures.

        Here we give very brief outline  of  the  MinNLC  optimizer.  We  strongly
        recommend you to study examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read
        ALGLIB User Guide on optimization, which is available at
        http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNLCCreate() call  and  chooses
           what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
           with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
           may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
           guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
           default settings.
           
           From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
           sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.
           
           In the current release following solvers can be used:
           * SLP solver (activated with minnlcsetalgoslp() function) -  successive
             linear programming, recommended as the first step.
           * AUL solver (activated with minnlcsetalgoaul() function)  -  augmented
             Lagrangian method with dense preconditioner.
         
           SLP solver is the most robust one  in  ALGLIB  and  converges  in  less
           iterations than AUL; however, each iteration has higher overhead  -  we
           have to solve an LP problem. From  the  other  side,  AUL  has  cheaper
           iterations - although it typically needs more of them, and also  it  is
           less robust in nonconvex setting.

        2. [optional] user activates OptGuard  integrity checker  which  tries  to
           detect possible errors in the user-supplied callbacks:
           * discontinuity/nonsmoothness of the target/nonlinear constraints
           * errors in the analytic gradient provided by user
           This feature is essential for early prototyping stages because it helps
           to catch common coding and problem statement errors.
           OptGuard can be activated with following functions (one per each  check
           performed):
           * minnlcoptguardsmoothness()
           * minnlcoptguardgradient()

        3. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
           of calling one of the following functions:
           a) minnlcsetbc() for boundary constraints
           b) minnlcsetlc() for linear constraints
           c) minnlcsetnlc() for nonlinear constraints
           You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.
           
        4. User sets scale of the variables with minnlcsetscale() function. It  is
           VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
           constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

        5. User sets  stopping  conditions  with  minnlcsetcond(). If  NLC  solver
           uses  inner/outer  iteration  layout,  this  function   sets   stopping
           conditions for INNER iterations.
           
        6. Finally, user calls minnlcoptimize()  function  which  takes  algorithm
           state and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates
           F/G/H.

        7. User calls  minnlcresults()  to  get  solution;  additionally  you  can
           retrieve OptGuard report with minnlcoptguardresults(), and get detailed
           report about purported errors in the target function with:
           * minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
           * minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()

        8. Optionally user may call minnlcrestartfrom() to solve  another  problem
           with same N but another starting point. minnlcrestartfrom()  allows  to
           reuse already initialized structure.

        This subroutine is a finite  difference variant of MinNLCCreate(). It uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to this  function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinNLCCreate() in order to get more
        information about creation of NLC optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used

                        * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try

            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinNLCSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large TRUNCATION  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large NUMERICAL  errors.  1.0E-4  can  be  good
           value to start from.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is  less   robust   and  precise.  Imprecise  gradient  may  slow  down
           convergence, especially on highly nonlinear problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        Boundary constraints are inactive by  default  (after  initial  creation).

        You may combine boundary constraints with  general  linear ones - and with
        nonlinear ones! Boundary constraints are  handled  more  efficiently  than
        other types.  Thus,  if  your  problem  has  mixed  constraints,  you  may
        explicitly specify some of them as boundary and save some time/space.

        variable will be "frozen" at X[i]=BndL[i]=BndU[i].

        NOTE 2:  when you solve your problem  with  augmented  Lagrangian  solver,
                 boundary constraints are  satisfied  only  approximately!  It  is
                 possible   that  algorithm  will  evaluate  function  outside  of

        This function sets nonlinear constraints for MinNLC optimizer.

        In fact, this function sets NUMBER of nonlinear  constraints.  Constraints
        itself (constraint functions) are passed to MinNLCOptimize() method.  This
        method requires user-defined vector function F[]  and  its  Jacobian  J[],
        where:
        * first component of F[] and first row  of  Jacobian  J[]  corresponds  to
          function being minimized
        * next NLEC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
          equality constraints G_i(x)=0
        * next NLIC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
          inequality constraints H_i(x)<=0

        NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If
              your problem has mixed constraints, you  may explicitly specify some
              of them as linear ones. It may help optimizer to  handle  them  more
              efficiently.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure previously allocated with MinNLCCreate call.
            NLEC    -   number of Non-Linear Equality Constraints (NLEC), >=0
            NLIC    -   number of Non-Linear Inquality Constraints (NLIC), >=0

        NOTE 1: when you solve your problem  with  augmented  Lagrangian   solver,
                nonlinear constraints are satisfied only  approximately!   It   is
                possible   that  algorithm  will  evaluate  function  outside   of
                feasible area!
                
        NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to   scale   specified   by
                MinNLCSetScale()  function,  so  it can handle problems with badly
                scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).
                   
                However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
                constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling  of  Gi/Hi  may
                ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  "1000*G0(x)=0"
                is NOT same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".
                   
                It  means  that  YOU  are  the  one who is responsible for correct
                scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend you
                to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component  of
                dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit  magnitude  (for  problems
                with unit scale)  or  has  magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i]
                (where S is a scale set by MinNLCSetScale() function).

        * no special assumptions about orthogonality of constraints
        * preconditioner evaluation is optimized for K<<N. Its cost  is  O(N*K^2),
          so it may become prohibitively slow for K>=N.
        * finally, stability of the process is guaranteed only for K<<N.  Woodbury
          update often fail for K>=N due to degeneracy of  intermediate  matrices.
          That's why we recommend to use "exact robust"  preconditioner  for  such
          cases.

        We  recommend  to  choose  between  "exact  low  rank"  and "exact robust"
        preconditioners, with "low rank" version being chosen  when  you  know  in

            UpdateFreq- update frequency. Preconditioner is  rebuilt  after  every

        Method for  Constrained  Minimization  (1999)"  by  D.GOLDFARB,  R.POLYAK,

        AUL solver can be significantly faster than SLP on easy problems, although
        it is less robust than SLP (the "gold standard" of robust optimization).

        of the form

            min[ f(x) +

          equality constraints
        * SHIFT_EQ(x) is a special "shift"  term  which  is  used  to  "fine-tune"
          equality constraints, greatly increasing precision
        * PENALTY_INEQ(x) is a penalty term which is used to approximately enforce
          inequality constraints
        * SHIFT_INEQ(x) is a special "shift"  term  which  is  used to "fine-tune"
          inequality constraints, greatly increasing precision
        * Nu1/Nu2 are vectors of Lagrange coefficients which are fine-tuned during
          outer iterations of algorithm

        accelerates convergence. Because this  algorithm  is  similar  to  penalty
        methods,  it  may  perform  steps  into  infeasible  area.  All  kinds  of
        constraints (boundary, linear and nonlinear ones) may   be   violated   in
        intermediate points - and in the solution.  However,  properly  configured
        AUL method is significantly better at handling  constraints  than  barrier
        and/or penalty methods.

        The very basic outline of algorithm is given below:
        1) first outer iteration is performed with "default"  values  of  Lagrange
           multipliers Nu1/Nu2. Solution quality is low (candidate  point  can  be
           too  far  away  from  true  solution; large violation of constraints is
           possible) and is comparable with that of penalty methods.
        2) subsequent outer iterations  refine  Lagrange  multipliers  and improve
           quality of the solution.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
            Rho     -   penalty coefficient, Rho>0:
                        * large enough  that  algorithm  converges  with   desired
                          precision. Minimum value is 10*max(S'*diag(H)*S),  where
                          S is a scale matrix (set by MinNLCSetScale) and H  is  a
                          Hessian of the function being minimized. If you can  not
                          easily estimate Hessian norm,  see  our  recommendations
                          below.
                        * not TOO large to prevent ill-conditioning
                        * for unit-scale problems (variables and Hessian have unit
                          magnitude), Rho=100 or Rho=1000 can be used.
                        * it is important to note that Rho is internally multiplied
                          by scaling matrix, i.e. optimum value of Rho depends  on
                          scale of variables specified  by  MinNLCSetScale().
            ItsCnt  -   number of outer iterations:
                        * ItsCnt=0 means that small number of outer iterations  is
                          automatically chosen (10 iterations in current version).
                        * ItsCnt=1 means that AUL algorithm performs just as usual
                          barrier method.
                        * ItsCnt>1 means that  AUL  algorithm  performs  specified
                          number of outer iterations
                        
        HOW TO CHOOSE PARAMETERS

        Nonlinear optimization is a tricky area and Augmented Lagrangian algorithm
        is sometimes hard to tune. Good values of  Rho  and  ItsCnt  are  problem-
        specific.  In  order  to  help  you   we   prepared   following   set   of
        recommendations:

        * for  unit-scale  problems  (variables  and Hessian have unit magnitude),
          Rho=100 or Rho=1000 can be used.

        * start from  some  small  value of Rho and solve problem  with  just  one
          outer iteration (ItcCnt=1). In this case algorithm behaves like  penalty
          method. Increase Rho in 2x or 10x steps until you  see  that  one  outer
          iteration returns point which is "rough approximation to solution".
          
          It is very important to have Rho so  large  that  penalty  term  becomes
          constraining i.e. modified function becomes highly convex in constrained
          directions.
          
          From the other side, too large Rho may prevent you  from  converging  to
          the solution. You can diagnose it by studying number of inner iterations
          performed by algorithm: too few (5-10 on  1000-dimensional  problem)  or
          too many (orders of magnitude more than  dimensionality)  usually  means
          that Rho is too large.

        * with just one outer iteration you  usually  have  low-quality  solution.
          Some constraints can be violated with very  large  margin,  while  other
          ones (which are NOT violated in the true solution) can push final  point
          too far in the inner area of the feasible set.
          
          For example, if you have constraint x0>=0 and true solution  x0=1,  then
          merely a presence of "x0>=0" will introduce a bias towards larger values
          of x0. Say, algorithm may stop at x0=1.5 instead of 1.0.
          
        * after you found good Rho, you may increase number of  outer  iterations.
          ItsCnt=10 is a good value. Subsequent outer iteration will refine values
          of  Lagrange  multipliers.  Constraints  which  were  violated  will  be
          enforced, inactive constraints will be dropped (corresponding multipliers
          will be decreased). Ideally, you  should  see  10-1000x  improvement  in
          constraint handling (constraint violation is reduced).
          
        * if  you  see  that  algorithm  converges  to  vicinity  of solution, but
          additional outer iterations do not refine solution,  it  may  mean  that
          algorithm is unstable - it wanders around true  solution,  but  can  not
          approach it. Sometimes algorithm may be stabilized by increasing Rho one
          more time, making it 5x or 10x larger.

        SCALING OF CONSTRAINTS [IMPORTANT]

        AUL optimizer scales   variables   according   to   scale   specified   by
        MinNLCSetScale() function, so it can handle  problems  with  badly  scaled
        variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).   However,  because  function
        being optimized is a mix  of  original  function and  constraint-dependent
        penalty  functions, it  is   important  to   rescale  both  variables  AND
        constraints.

        Say,  if  you  minimize f(x)=x^2 subject to 1000000*x>=0,  then  you  have
        constraint whose scale is different from that of target  function (another
        example is 0.000001*x>=0). It is also possible to have constraints   whose
        scales  are   misaligned:   1000000*x0>=0, 0.000001*x1<=0.   Inappropriate
        scaling may ruin convergence because minimizing x^2 subject to x>=0 is NOT
        same as minimizing it subject to 1000000*x>=0.

        Because we  know  coefficients  of  boundary/linear  constraints,  we  can
        automatically rescale and normalize them. However,  there  is  no  way  to
        automatically rescale nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and  Hi(x)  -  they  are
        black boxes.

        It means that YOU are the one who is  responsible  for  correct scaling of
        nonlinear constraints  Gi(x)  and  Hi(x).  We  recommend  you  to  rescale
        nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component of dG/dX (or  dH/dx)
        has magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i] (where S  is  a  scale  set by
        MinNLCSetScale() function).

        WHAT IF IT DOES NOT CONVERGE?

        It is possible that AUL algorithm fails to converge to precise  values  of
        Lagrange multipliers. It stops somewhere around true solution, but candidate
        point is still too far from solution, and some constraints  are  violated.
        Such kind of failure is specific for Lagrangian algorithms -  technically,
        they stop at some point, but this point is not constrained solution.

        There are exist several reasons why algorithm may fail to converge:
        a) too loose stopping criteria for inner iteration
        b) degenerate, redundant constraints
        c) target function has unconstrained extremum exactly at the  boundary  of
           some constraint
        d) numerical noise in the target function

        In all these cases algorithm is unstable - each outer iteration results in
        large and almost random step which improves handling of some  constraints,
        but violates other ones (ideally  outer iterations should form a  sequence
        of progressively decreasing steps towards solution).
           
        First reason possible is  that  too  loose  stopping  criteria  for  inner
        iteration were specified. Augmented Lagrangian algorithm solves a sequence
        of intermediate problems, and requries each of them to be solved with high
        precision. Insufficient precision results in incorrect update of  Lagrange
        multipliers.

        Another reason is that you may have specified degenerate constraints: say,
        some constraint was repeated twice. In most cases AUL algorithm gracefully
        handles such situations, but sometimes it may spend too much time figuring
        out subtle degeneracies in constraint matrix.

        Third reason is tricky and hard to diagnose. Consider situation  when  you
        minimize  f=x^2  subject to constraint x>=0.  Unconstrained   extremum  is
        located  exactly  at  the  boundary  of  constrained  area.  In  this case
        algorithm will tend to oscillate between negative  and  positive  x.  Each
        time it stops at x<0 it "reinforces" constraint x>=0, and each time it  is
        bounced to x>0 it "relaxes" constraint (and is  attracted  to  x<0).

        Such situation  sometimes  happens  in  problems  with  hidden  symetries.
        Algorithm  is  got  caught  in  a  loop with  Lagrange  multipliers  being
        continuously increased/decreased. Luckily, such loop forms after at  least
        three iterations, so this problem can be solved by  DECREASING  number  of
        outer iterations down to 1-2 and increasing  penalty  coefficient  Rho  as
        much as possible.

        Final reason is numerical noise. AUL algorithm is robust against  moderate
        noise (more robust than, say, active set methods),  but  large  noise  may
        destabilize algorithm.

        This   function  tells  MinNLC  optimizer  to  use  SLP (Successive Linear
        Programming) algorithm for  nonlinearly  constrained   optimization.  This
        algorithm  is  a  slight  modification  of  one  described  in  "A  Linear
        programming-based optimization algorithm for solving nonlinear programming
        problems" (2010) by Claus Still and Tapio Westerlund.

        Despite its name ("linear" = "first order method") this algorithm performs
        steps similar to that of conjugate gradients method;  internally  it  uses
        orthogonality/conjugacy requirement for subsequent steps  which  makes  it
        closer to second order methods in terms of convergence speed.

        Convergence is proved for the following case:
        * function and constraints are continuously differentiable (C1 class)
        * extended Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification  (EMFCQ)  holds;
          in the context of this algorithm EMFCQ  means  that  one  can,  for  any
          infeasible  point,  find  a  search  direction  such that the constraint
          infeasibilities are reduced.

        This algorithm has following nice properties:
        * no parameters to tune
        * no convexity requirements for target function or constraints
        * initial point can be infeasible
        * algorithm respects box constraints in all intermediate points  (it  does
          not even evaluate function outside of box constrained area)
        * once linear constraints are enforced, algorithm will not violate them
        * no such guarantees can be provided for nonlinear constraints,  but  once
          nonlinear constraints are enforced, algorithm will try  to  respect them
          as much as possible
        * numerical differentiation does not  violate  box  constraints  (although
          general linear and nonlinear ones can be violated during differentiation)

        However, following drawbacks can be noted:
        * algorithm performance decreased on problems with dense constraints
        * it has higher iteration cost than AUL - we have to solve an  LP  problem
          at each step.

        We recommend this algorithm as a first step; as soon as you make sure that
        it converges, you can try switching to AUL which is sometimes much faster.

        This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
        analytic gradient/Jacobian.

        Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
        numerical differentiation of your target  function  (constraints)  at  the
        initial point (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the final
        point) and compares numerical gradient/Jacobian with analytic one provided
        by you.

        If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
        continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
        which stores both gradients/Jacobians, and specific components highlighted
        as suspicious by the OptGuard.

        The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minnlcoptguardresults().

        IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
                   about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
                   cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.
                   
                   YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
                   CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

        NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
              does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.
              
        INPUT PARAMETERS:

                            You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                            too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                            cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                            short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating

            of i-th parameter
          * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
            points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle

        /*************************************************************************
        This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
        the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
        solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
        a) discontinuous target function (non-C0) and/or constraints
        b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1) and/or constraints

        Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
        that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
        OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

        Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
        than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
        scale problems.

        NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
              continuity violations.
              
              First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
              the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
              of the model - or simply because the model has changed.
              
              Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
              noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
              near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
              lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
              discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
              to numerical noise alone.
              
              Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
              minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
              spotted with restart from different initial point).

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state
            level   -   monitoring level:
                        * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                        * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                              and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                              try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                              get more information about suspicious locations.
          
        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

        One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
        the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
        Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
        nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

        Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
        lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
        coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
        stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

        OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
        function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
        errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
        flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
        you can study OptGuard result.

        Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
        session is over.

        === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

        OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
        in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
        * incorrect analytic gradient
        * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
        * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

        Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
        * minnlcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
        * minnlcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

        Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
        * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
          * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
          * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected
          * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient/Jacobian is tested
          * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient/Jacobian
          * rep.badgradnum, reference gradient/Jacobian obtained via numerical
            differentiation
        * rep.nonc0suspected, and additionally:
          * rep.nonc0fidx - an index of specific function violating C0 continuity
        * rep.nonc1suspected, and additionally
          * rep.nonc1fidx - an index of specific function violating C1 continuity
        Here function index 0 means  target function, index 1  or  higher  denotes
        nonlinear constraints.

        === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================
            
        Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
        out specific test signaled error by looking to:
        * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

        Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
        means of:
        * minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
        * minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()
        which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
        were found, and so on.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                        retrieved with other functions.

        NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
              ones) are possible although unlikely.
              
              The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
              nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
              function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
              optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
              wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
              It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
              termination too quickly.
              
              Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
              our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
              points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

        obtained during line searches and monitors  behavior  of  the  directional
        derivative estimate.

        This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
        gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
        numerical differentiation.

        Two reports are returned:
        * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
          value of the nonsmoothness indicator
        * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
          evaluations, and thus is more detailed

        In both cases following fields are returned:

        * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
          did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
        * fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
          for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
        * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction

        * stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
          values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
        * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
          between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,

        Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

        Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
        gradient computed during line search.

        When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
        test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
        gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
        differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
        of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

        This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
        continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
        continuity is violated.

        Two reports are returned:
        * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
          value of the nonsmoothness indicator
        * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
          evaluations, and thus is more detailed

        In both cases following fields are returned:

        * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
          did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
        * fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
          for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
        * vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
        * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
          for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
        * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
          values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
          vidx-th component of the gradient.
        * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
          between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
          with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and
          stpidxa+2.

        =                   see where C1 continuity is violated.

        arbitrarily small! - it enforces  convexity  of  the  problem  behind  the

        This function is zero at the feasible area and in the close  neighborhood,
        it becomes non-zero only at some distance (scaling is essential!) and grows
        quadratically.

        Penalty function must enter augmented Lagrangian as

        constraints.

                             BOX CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
                  WITH FAST ACTIVATION OF MULTIPLE BOX CONSTRAINTS

        DESCRIPTION:
        The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x) of N arguments subject  to box
        constraints (with some of box constraints actually being equality ones).

        This optimizer uses algorithm similar to that of MinBLEIC (optimizer  with
        general linear constraints), but presence of box-only  constraints  allows
        us to use faster constraint activation strategies. On large-scale problems,
        with multiple constraints active at the solution, this  optimizer  can  be
        several times faster than BLEIC.

        REQUIREMENTS:
        * user must provide function value and gradient
        * starting point X0 must be feasible or
          not too far away from the feasible set
        * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
          L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
        * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

        USAGE:

        Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
        Here we give very brief outline of the BC optimizer. We strongly recommend
        you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
        on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBCCreate() call

        2. USer adds box constraints by calling MinBCSetBC() function.

        3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBCSetCond().

        4. User calls MinBCOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

        5. User calls MinBCResults() to get solution

        6. Optionally user may call MinBCRestartFrom() to solve another problem
           with same N but another starting point.
           MinBCRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
            X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                        * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                        * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                          to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                          approximation.

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state

        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBCCreate().  It  uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinBCCreate() in  order  to  get
        more information about creation of BC optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBCSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
           gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
           problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for BC optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBCSetPrec...()
        functions.

        There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state

        Modification of the preconditioner: scale-based diagonal preconditioning.

        This preconditioning mode can be useful when you  don't  have  approximate
        diagonal of Hessian, but you know that your  variables  are  badly  scaled
        (for  example,  one  variable is in [1,10], and another in [1000,100000]),
        and most part of the ill-conditioning comes from different scales of vars.

        In this case simple  scale-based  preconditioner,  with H[i] = 1/(s[i]^2),
        can greatly improve convergence.

        IMPRTANT: you should set scale of your variables  with  MinBCSetScale()
        call  (before  or after MinBCSetPrecScale() call). Without knowledge of
        the scale of your variables scale-based preconditioner will be  just  unit
        matrix.

        NOTES:

        1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
           (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
           only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
           gradient.

           Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
           (either  MinBCCreate() for analytical gradient or  MinBCCreateF()
           for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
           MinBCOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
           which accepts function ONLY.

           Be careful to choose variant of MinBCOptimize() which corresponds to
           your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
           callback (function/gradient) passed to MinBCOptimize()  and specific
           function used to create optimizer.

           Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
           function  and  MinBCOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
           combination (for  example,  to  create optimizer with MinBCCreateF()
           and  to  pass  gradient  information  to  MinCGOptimize()) will lead to
           exception being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS
           needed or you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

        This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
        analytic gradient.

        Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
        numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
        (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
        compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

        If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
        continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
        which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
        suspicious by the OptGuard.

        The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minbcoptguardresults().

        IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
                   about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
                   cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.
                   
                   YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
                   CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

        NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
              does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.
              
        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
            TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                            * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                            * TestStep>0 activates verification
                            You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                            too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                            cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                            short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                            numerical derivative.
                            
                            You may use different step for different parameters by
                            means of setting scale with minbcsetscale().

        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================                    

        In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:

            where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
            of i-th parameter
          * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
            points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
            point

        This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
        the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
        solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
        a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
        b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

        Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
        that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
        OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

        Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
        than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
        scale problems.

        NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
              continuity violations.
              
              First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
              the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
              of the model - or simply because the model has changed.
              
              Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
              noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
              near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
              lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
              discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
              to numerical noise alone.
              
              Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
              minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
              spotted with restart from different initial point).

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state
            level   -   monitoring level:
                        * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                        * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                              and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                              try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                              get more information about suspicious locations.
          
        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

        One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
        the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
        Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
        nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

        Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
        lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
        coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
        stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

        OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
        function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
        errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
        flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
        you can study OptGuard result.

        Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
        session is over.

        === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

        OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
        in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
        * incorrect analytic gradient
        * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
        * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

        Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
        * minbcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
        * minbcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

        Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
        * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
          * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
          * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
          * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
            single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
            complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
          * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
            differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
            report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
            or MinLM)
        * rep.nonc0suspected
        * rep.nonc1suspected

        === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================
            
        Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
        out specific test signaled error by looking to:
        * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

        Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
        means of:
        * minbcoptguardnonc1test0results()
        * minbcoptguardnonc1test1results()
        which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
        were found, and so on.

        ==========================================================================
             
        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                        retrieved with other functions.

        NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
              ones) are possible although unlikely.
              
              The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
              nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
              function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
              optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
              wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
              It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
              termination too quickly.
              
              Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
              our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
              points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

        obtained during line searches and monitors  behavior  of  the  directional
        derivative estimate.

        This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
        gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
        numerical differentiation.

        Two reports are returned:
        * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
          value of the nonsmoothness indicator
        * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
          evaluations, and thus is more detailed

        In both cases following fields are returned:

        * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
          did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
        * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
          for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
        * stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
          values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
        * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
          between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
          with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and

        Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

        Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
        gradient computed during line search.

        When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
        test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
        gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
        differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
        of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

        This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
        continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
        continuity is violated.

        Two reports are returned:
        * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
          value of the nonsmoothness indicator
        * a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
          evaluations, and thus is more detailed

        In both cases following fields are returned:

        * positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
          did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
        * vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
        * x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
          for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
        * stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
          values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
          vidx-th component of the gradient.
        * stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
          between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
          with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and
          stpidxa+2.

                          NONSMOOTH NONCONVEX OPTIMIZATION
                    SUBJECT TO BOX/LINEAR/NONLINEAR-NONSMOOTH CONSTRAINTS

        DESCRIPTION:

        The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
        combination of:
        * bound constraints
        * linear inequality constraints
        * linear equality constraints
        * nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
        * nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)<=0

        IMPORTANT: see MinNSSetAlgoAGS for important  information  on  performance
                   restrictions of AGS solver.

        REQUIREMENTS:
        * starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
          set
        * F(), G(), H() are continuous, locally Lipschitz  and  continuously  (but
          not necessarily twice) differentiable in an open dense  subset  of  R^N.
          Functions F(), G() and H() may be nonsmooth and non-convex.
          Informally speaking, it means  that  functions  are  composed  of  large
          differentiable "patches" with nonsmoothness having  place  only  at  the
          boundaries between these "patches".
          Most real-life nonsmooth  functions  satisfy  these  requirements.  Say,
          anything which involves finite number of abs(), min() and max() is  very
          likely to pass the test.
          Say, it is possible to optimize anything of the following:
          * f=abs(x0)+2*abs(x1)
          * f=max(x0,x1)
          * f=sin(max(x0,x1)+abs(x2))
        * for nonlinearly constrained problems: F()  must  be  bounded from  below
          without nonlinear constraints (this requirement is due to the fact that,
          contrary to box and linear constraints, nonlinear ones  require  special
          handling).
        * user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()  at  all
          points where function/gradient can be calculated. If optimizer  requires
          value exactly at the boundary between "patches" (say, at x=0 for f=abs(x)),
          where gradient is not defined, user may resolve tie arbitrarily (in  our
          case - return +1 or -1 at its discretion).
        * NS solver supports numerical differentiation, i.e. it may  differentiate
          your function for you,  but  it  results  in  2N  increase  of  function
          evaluations. Not recommended unless you solve really small problems. See
          minnscreatef() for more information on this functionality.

        USAGE:

        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNSCreate() call  and   chooses
           what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
           with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
           may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
           guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
           default settings.

           From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
           sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.

           In the current release following solvers can be used:
           * AGS solver (activated with MinNSSetAlgoAGS() function)

        2. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
           of calling one of the following functions:
           a) MinNSSetBC() for boundary constraints
           b) MinNSSetLC() for linear constraints
           c) MinNSSetNLC() for nonlinear constraints
           You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.

        3. User sets scale of the variables with MinNSSetScale() function. It   is
           VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
           constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

        4. User sets stopping conditions with MinNSSetCond().

        5. Finally, user calls MinNSOptimize()  function  which  takes   algorithm
           state and pointer (delegate, etc) to callback function which calculates
           F/G/H.

        7. User calls MinNSResults() to get solution

        8. Optionally user may call MinNSRestartFrom() to solve   another  problem
           with same N but another starting point. MinNSRestartFrom()  allows   to
           reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:

            X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                        * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                        * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                          to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                          approximation.

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state

        NOTE: minnscreatef() function may be used if  you  do  not  have  analytic
              gradient.   This   function  creates  solver  which  uses  numerical
              differentiation with user-specified step.

        NOTE: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:

        * there always exists some minor violation (about current sampling  radius
          in magnitude during optimization, about EpsX in the solution) due to use
          of penalty method to handle constraints.
        * numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
          outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
          numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.

        If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
        problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
        (this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final

        This function sets nonlinear constraints.

        In fact, this function sets NUMBER of nonlinear  constraints.  Constraints
        itself (constraint functions) are passed to minnsoptimize() method.   This
        method requires user-defined vector function F[]  and  its  Jacobian  J[],
        where:
        * first component of F[] and first row  of  Jacobian  J[]  correspond   to
          function being minimized
        * next NLEC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
          equality constraints G_i(x)=0
        * next NLIC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
          inequality constraints H_i(x)<=0

        NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If
              your problem has mixed constraints, you  may explicitly specify some
              of them as linear ones. It may help optimizer to  handle  them  more
              efficiently.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure previously allocated with minnscreate() call.
            NLEC    -   number of Non-Linear Equality Constraints (NLEC), >=0
            NLIC    -   number of Non-Linear Inquality Constraints (NLIC), >=0

        NOTE 1: nonlinear constraints are satisfied only  approximately!   It   is
                possible   that  algorithm  will  evaluate  function  outside   of
                the feasible area!

        NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to   scale   specified   by
                minnssetscale()  function,  so  it can handle problems with  badly
                scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).

                However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
                constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling  of  Gi/Hi  may
                ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  "1000*G0(x)=0"
                is NOT same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".

                It  means  that  YOU  are  the  one who is responsible for correct
                scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend you
                to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component  of
                dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit  magnitude  (for  problems
                with unit scale)  or  has  magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i]
                (where S is a scale set by minnssetscale() function).

        NOTE 3: nonlinear constraints are always hard to handle,  no  matter  what
                algorithm you try to use. Even basic box/linear constraints modify
                function  curvature   by  adding   valleys  and  ridges.  However,
                nonlinear constraints add valleys which are very  hard  to  follow
                due to their "curved" nature.

                It means that optimization with single nonlinear constraint may be
                significantly slower than optimization with multiple linear  ones.
                It is normal situation, and we recommend you to  carefully  choose
                Rho parameter of minnssetalgoags(), because too  large  value  may
                slow down convergence.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for NLC optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state
            S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients
                        S[i] may be negative, sign doesn't matter.

        This function tells MinNS unit to use  AGS  (adaptive  gradient  sampling)
        algorithm for nonsmooth constrained  optimization.  This  algorithm  is  a
        slight modification of one described in  "An  Adaptive  Gradient  Sampling
        Algorithm for Nonsmooth Optimization" by Frank E. Curtisy and Xiaocun Quez.

        This optimizer has following benefits and drawbacks:
        + robustness; it can be used with nonsmooth and nonconvex functions.
        + relatively easy tuning; most of the metaparameters are easy to select.
        - it has convergence of steepest descent, slower than CG/LBFGS.
        - each iteration involves evaluation of ~2N gradient values  and  solution
          of 2Nx2N quadratic programming problem, which  limits  applicability  of
          algorithm by small-scale problems (up to 50-100).

        IMPORTANT: this  algorithm  has  convergence  guarantees,   i.e.  it  will
                   steadily move towards some stationary point of the function.

                   However, "stationary point" does not  always  mean  "solution".
                   Nonsmooth problems often have "flat spots",  i.e.  areas  where
                   function do not change at all. Such "flat spots" are stationary
                   points by definition, and algorithm may be caught here.

                   Nonsmooth CONVEX tasks are not prone to  this  problem. Say, if
                   your function has form f()=MAX(f0,f1,...), and f_i are  convex,
                   then f() is convex too and you have guaranteed  convergence  to
                   solution.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
            Radius  -   initial sampling radius, >=0.

                        Internally multiplied  by  vector of  per-variable  scales
                        specified by minnssetscale()).

                        You should select relatively large sampling radius, roughly
                        proportional to scaled length of the first  steps  of  the
                        algorithm. Something close to 0.1 in magnitude  should  be
                        good for most problems.

                        AGS solver can automatically decrease radius, so too large
                        radius is  not a problem (assuming that you  won't  choose
                        so large radius that algorithm  will  sample  function  in
                        too far away points, where gradient value is irrelevant).

                        Too small radius won't cause algorithm to fail, but it may
                        slow down algorithm (it may  have  to  perform  too  short
                        steps).
            Penalty -   penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints:
                        * for problem with nonlinear constraints  should  be  some
                          problem-specific  positive   value,  large  enough  that
                          penalty term changes shape of the function.
                          Starting  from  some  problem-specific   value   penalty
                          coefficient becomes  large  enough  to  exactly  enforce
                          nonlinear constraints;  larger  values  do  not  improve
                          precision.
                          Increasing it too much may slow down convergence, so you
                          should choose it carefully.
                        * can be zero for problems WITHOUT  nonlinear  constraints
                          (i.e. for unconstrained ones or ones with  just  box  or
                          linear constraints)
                        * if you specify zero value for problem with at least  one
                          nonlinear  constraint,  algorithm  will  terminate  with
                          error code -1.

        ALGORITHM OUTLINE

        The very basic outline of unconstrained AGS algorithm is given below:

        0. If sampling radius is below EpsX  or  we  performed  more  then  MaxIts
           iterations - STOP.
        1. sample O(N) gradient values at random locations  around  current point;
           informally speaking, this sample is an implicit piecewise  linear model
           of the function, although algorithm formulation does  not  mention that
           explicitly
        2. solve quadratic programming problem in order to find descent direction
        3. if QP solver tells us that we  are  near  solution,  decrease  sampling
           radius and move to (0)
        4. perform backtracking line search
        5. after moving to new point, goto (0)

        As for the constraints:
        * box constraints are handled exactly  by  modification  of  the  function
          being minimized
        * linear/nonlinear constraints are handled by adding L1  penalty.  Because
          our solver can handle nonsmoothness, we can  use  L1  penalty  function,
          which is an exact one  (i.e.  exact  solution  is  returned  under  such
          penalty).
        * penalty coefficient for  linear  constraints  is  chosen  automatically;
          however, penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints must be specified
          by user.

        NOTES:

        1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact

           vector and numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
           gradient.

           Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
           you should choose appropriate variant of  minnsoptimize() -  one  which
           accepts function AND Jacobian or one which accepts ONLY function.

           Be careful to choose variant of minnsoptimize()  which  corresponds  to
           your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
           callback (function/gradient) passed to minnsoptimize()    and  specific

                NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

        DESCRIPTION:
        The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
        nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

        These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
        long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
        L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


        REQUIREMENTS:
        Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
        * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
           other functions
        3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
        4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
           with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
           MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
        information about creation of CG optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
           Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
           nonlinear problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

        There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

        This function allows to suggest initial step length to the CG algorithm.

        Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It
        can be useful when you have  badly  scaled  problem,  i.e.  when  ||grad||
        (which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
        magnitude different from the desired step.

        Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
        step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
        step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,
        then  it  will  decrease step length by 2 (up to 20 attempts) and will get
        10^44, which is still too large.

        This function allows us to tell than line search should  be  started  from
        some moderate step length, like 1.0, so algorithm will be able  to  detect
        desired step length in a several searches.

           Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object

        /*************************************************************************
        This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
        analytic gradient.

        Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
        numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
        (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
        compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

        If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
        continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
        which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
        suspicious by the OptGuard.

        The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with mincgoptguardresults().

        IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
                   about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
                   cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.
                   
                   YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
                   CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

        NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
              does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.
              
        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
            TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                            * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                            * TestStep>0 activates verification
                            You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                            too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                            cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                            short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                            numerical derivative.
                            
                            You may use different step for different parameters by
                            means of setting scale with mincgsetscale().

        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================                    

        In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
          * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
            where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
            of i-th parameter
          * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
            points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
            point

        that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
        OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

        Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
        than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
        scale problems.

        NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
              continuity violations.
              
              First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
              the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
              of the model - or simply because the model has changed.
              
              Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
              noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
              near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
              lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
              discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
              to numerical noise alone.
              
              Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
              minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
              spotted with restart from different initial point).

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state
            level   -   monitoring level:
                        * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                        * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                              and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                              try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                              get more information about suspicious locations.
          
        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================

        One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
        the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
        Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
        nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

        Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
        lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
        coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
        stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

        OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
        function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
        errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
        flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
        you can study OptGuard result.

        Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
        session is over.

        === PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

        OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
        in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
        * incorrect analytic gradient
        * discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
        * nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

        Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
        * mincgoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
        * mincgoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

        Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
        * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
          * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
          * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
          * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
            single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
            complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
          * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
            differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
            report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
            or MinLM)
        * rep.nonc0suspected
        * rep.nonc1suspected

        === ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================
            
        Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
        out specific test signaled error by looking to:
        * rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
        * rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

        Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
        means of:
        * mincgoptguardnonc1test0results()
        * mincgoptguardnonc1test1results()
        which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
        were found, and so on.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            state   -   algorithm state

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                        retrieved with other functions.

        NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
              ones) are possible although unlikely.
              
              The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
              nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
              function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
              optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
              wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
              It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
              termination too quickly.
              
              Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
              our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
              points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

        Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
        gradient computed during line search.

        When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
        test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
        gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
        differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
        of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

        This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
        continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
        continuity is violated.

        Two reports are returned:
        * a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest

        /*************************************************************************
        This function sets low-rank preconditioner for Hessian matrix  H=D+V'*C*V,
        where:
        * H is a Hessian matrix, which is approximated by D/V/C
        * D=D1+D2 is a diagonal matrix, which includes two positive definite terms:
          * constant term D1 (is not updated or infrequently updated)
          * variable term D2 (can be cheaply updated from iteration to iteration)
        * V is a low-rank correction
        * C is a diagonal factor of low-rank correction

        Preconditioner P is calculated using approximate Woodburry formula:
            P  = D^(-1) - D^(-1)*V'*(C^(-1)+V*D1^(-1)*V')^(-1)*V*D^(-1)
               = D^(-1) - D^(-1)*VC'*VC*D^(-1),
        where
            VC = sqrt(B)*V
            B  = (C^(-1)+V*D1^(-1)*V')^(-1)
            
        Note that B is calculated using constant term (D1) only,  which  allows us
        to update D2 without recalculation of B or   VC.  Such  preconditioner  is
        exact when D2 is zero. When D2 is non-zero, it is only approximation,  but
        very good and cheap one.

        This function accepts D1, V, C.
        D2 is set to zero by default.

        Cost of this update is O(N*VCnt*VCnt), but D2 can be updated in just O(N)
        by MinCGSetPrecVarPart.

                        IMPROVED LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT METHOD FOR
                         NON-LINEAR LEAST SQUARES OPTIMIZATION

        DESCRIPTION:
        This function is used to find minimum of function which is represented  as
        sum of squares:
            F(x) = f[0]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1]) + ... + f[m-1]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1])
        using value of function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[].


        REQUIREMENTS:
        This algorithm will request following information during its operation:

        * function vector f[] at given point X
        * function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[] (simultaneously) at given point

        There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
        correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
        unit. You should choose version which accepts fvec()  and jac() callbacks.
        First  one  is used to calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates
        f[] and Jacobian df[i]/dx[j].

        You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ  function and  then
        use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize()  (for  example,  version  which
        works  with  general  form function and does not provide Jacobian), but it
        will  lead  to  exception  being  thrown  after first attempt to calculate
        Jacobian.


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateVJ() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
           other functions
        3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
           callback functions.
        4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
           with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
           MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   dimension, N>1
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            M       -   number of functions f[i]
            X       -   initial solution, array[0..N-1]

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function
        2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
           optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
           use MinLMSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's steps.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for LM optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
        optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
        condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

        Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
        important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is
        easier  to  converge  when  variables  are  properly  scaled, so premature
        stopping is possible when very badly scalled variables are  combined  with
        relaxed stopping conditions).

        This function sets general linear constraints for LM optimizer

        Linear constraints are inactive by default (after initial creation).  They
        are preserved until explicitly turned off with another minlmsetlc() call.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state
            C       -   linear constraints, array[K,N+1].
                        Each row of C represents one constraint, either equality
                        or inequality (see below):
                        * first N elements correspond to coefficients,
                        * last element corresponds to the right part.
                        All elements of C (including right part) must be finite.
            CT      -   type of constraints, array[K]:
                        * if CT[i]>0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x >= C[i,n+1]
                        * if CT[i]=0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x  = C[i,n+1]
                        * if CT[i]<0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x <= C[i,n+1]
            K       -   number of equality/inequality constraints, K>=0:
                        * if given, only leading K elements of C/CT are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from sizes of C/CT

        IMPORTANT: if you have linear constraints, it is strongly  recommended  to
                   set scale of variables with minlmsetscale(). QP solver which is
                   used to calculate linearly constrained steps heavily relies  on
                   good scaling of input problems.

        IMPORTANT: solvers created with minlmcreatefgh()  do  not  support  linear
                   constraints.
                   
        NOTE: linear  (non-bound)  constraints are satisfied only approximately  -
              there  always  exists some violation due  to  numerical  errors  and
              algorithmic limitations.

        NOTE: general linear constraints  add  significant  overhead  to  solution
              process. Although solver performs roughly same amount of  iterations
              (when compared  with  similar  box-only  constrained  problem), each
              iteration   now    involves  solution  of  linearly  constrained  QP
              subproblem, which requires ~3-5 times more Cholesky  decompositions.
              Thus, if you can reformulate your problem in such way  this  it  has
              only box constraints, it may be beneficial to do so.

        This function is used to change acceleration settings

        You can choose between three acceleration strategies:
        * AccType=0, no acceleration.
        * AccType=1, secant updates are used to update quadratic model after  each
          iteration. After fixed number of iterations (or after  model  breakdown)
          we  recalculate  quadratic  model  using  analytic  Jacobian  or  finite
          differences. Number of secant-based iterations depends  on  optimization
          settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
          iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.

        AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost is prohibitively
        high (several Mx1 function vector calculations  followed  by  several  NxN
        Cholesky factorizations are faster than calculation of one M*N  Jacobian).
        It should also be used when we have no Jacobian, because finite difference
        approximation takes too much time to compute.

        Table below list  optimization  protocols  (XYZ  protocol  corresponds  to
        MinLMCreateXYZ) and acceleration types they support (and use by  default).

        ACCELERATION TYPES SUPPORTED BY OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOLS:

        protocol    0   1   comment
        V           +   +
        VJ          +   +
        FGH         +

        DEFAULT VALUES:

        protocol    0   1   comment
        V               x   without acceleration it is so slooooooooow
        VJ          x
        FGH         x

        NOTE: this  function should be called before optimization. Attempt to call
        it during algorithm iterations may result in unexpected behavior.

        NOTE: attempt to call this function with unsupported protocol/acceleration
        combination will result in exception being thrown.

        NOTES:

        1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
           may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
           said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
           different sets of callbacks.

           This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
           MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
           does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
           will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

           Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
           compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

        This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
        analytic Jacobian.

        Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
        numerical differentiation of your target function vector  at  the  initial
        point (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the final  point)
        and compares numerical Jacobian with analytic one provided by you.

        If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
        continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
        which stores  both  Jacobians,  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
        suspicious by the OptGuard.

        The OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlmoptguardresults().

        IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
                   about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
                   cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.
                   
                   YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
                   CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

        NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
              does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.
              
        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
            TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                            * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                            * TestStep>0 activates verification
                            You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                            too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                            cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                            short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                            numerical derivative.
                            
                            You may use different step for different parameters by
                            means of setting scale with minlmsetscale().

        === EXPLANATION ==========================================================                    

        In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
          * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
            where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
            of i-th parameter
          * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
            points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
            point

        Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
        session is over.

        OptGuard checks analytic Jacobian  against  reference  value  obtained  by
        numerical differentiation with user-specified step.

        NOTE: other optimizers perform additional OptGuard checks for things  like
              C0/C1-continuity violations. However, LM optimizer  can  check  only
              for incorrect Jacobian.
              
              The reason is that unlike line search methods LM optimizer does  not
              perform extensive evaluations along the line. Thus, we simply do not
              have enough data to catch C0/C1-violations.

        This check is activated with  minlmoptguardgradient() function.

        Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
        * rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
          * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
          * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected
          * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient/Jacobian is tested
          * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient/Jacobian
